					<description><![CDATA[Dear colleagues, Last spring, we invited proposals for planning awards [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>Last spring, we invited proposals for planning awards to develop a small number of new university research institutes at UIC. We were overwhelmed by the many outstanding proposals submitted, representing 600 faculty and every college.</p>
<p>The Executive Cabinet and OVCR engaged leadership from the Faculty Senate Executive Committee and Faculty Senate Research Subcommittee to ensure proposals went through a rigorous review process.  Senate leaders developed a rubric for determining a fair and thorough assessment. The Executive Cabinet, OVCR, Faculty Senate Research Subcommittee and other strategic campus leaders, faculty and researchers who were not represented on any submitted proposal then reviewed and scored proposals, ultimately yielding a short list of finalists.</p>
<p>We are delighted to announce four proposals have been selected for further development. These teams may receive up to $2 million each over the next four years to expand interdisciplinary research efforts that could not be achieved by any one individual, department, college or discipline, and create collective research efforts that are greater than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p><strong>Addiction and Mental Health: “Addictions in Context, Advancing Interventions,”</strong> led by faculty from Applied Health Sciences, CCTS, College of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Jane Addams College of Social Work and School of Public Health.</p>
<p><strong>Energy and the Environment: “Advanced Materials for Green Energy Sustainability,”</strong> led by faculty from College of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the Institute for Environmental Science and Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Functional Materials Sciences: “Functional and Regenerative Materials,”</strong> led by faculty from College of Dentistry, College of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and College of Medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Sciences: “Translational Vision Science and Technology,”</strong> led by faculty from College of Dentistry, College of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Medicine and College of Pharmacy.</p>
<p>We also received many impressive proposals for research in the broad topics of data science and health informatics. While meritorious, some of these projects were overlapping or complementary in both topic areas and faculty. An Institute Planning Award will be supported on these topics, but further facilitated discussion to refine the scope of the project and the team of investigators is pending.</p>
<p>The creativity and breadth of scope in the pool of submitted proposals were energizing. We want to convey how much we appreciate all efforts toward building interdisciplinary teams among our campus colleagues to advance research at UIC. OVCR research leaders are already working to identify alternative approaches to secure external funding for some of the many terrific proposals that cannot be supported by the budget of this program.</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="https://research.uic.edu/institute-planning-awards">the Institute Planning Awards website</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Congratulations to those selected to move forward!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear UIC students:</p>
<p>The Spring 2023 CTA U-PASS program will be similar to the fall semester. All students that set their opt-in status in the fall 2022 semester will have that status carried over to the spring 2023 semester. Students that did not change their status in the fall will remain at the default status of opt-out. We encourage all students to review their current status to confirm it is set correctly <a href="https://go.uic.edu/spring_upass">here</a>. If you do not wish to utilize the U-PASS benefit, there is no action to take.</p>
<p>For spring 2023, the CTA U-PASS will be available for any student (undergraduate/professional/graduate) taking six or more credits.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Spring U-PASS will be active from Jan. 4–May 10 (dates for the College of Medicine are Dec. 29-Apr. 27, and the College of Dentistry is Dec. 28-May 3).</li>
<li>The deadline to opt-in for the Spring U-PASS is Jan. 29, 2023, at 11:59 p.m.</li>
<li>After Jan. 29, the status cannot change for the duration of the spring semester.</li>
<li>Students who drop below part-time status prior to the add/drop deadline will have their U-PASS deactivated.</li>
<li>A mandatory fee of $163 ($175 for College of Medicine) will be applied to student accounts after the start date and is nonrefundable after the deadline.</li>
<li>Students that opt-out may see the U-PASS fee assessed on their university bill, but that charge will be reversed within 7-10 business days. (There will be no fee removed if students opt-out before the fee is assessed to the student account.)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://go.uic.edu/spring_upass">Confirm or make changes</a> to your status for the Spring 2023 U-PASS benefit online. Students obtaining a new U-PASS for Spring 2023 may request delivery at the same link. For students with existing U-PASS cards, the standard policies on lost/replacement cards will still be enforced.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

Interim Vice Chancellor and Vice Provost for Student Affairs</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>Last week, we opened a national search for the next dean of the UIC College of Business Administration. Michael Mikhail returned to the faculty in August, and Sandy Wayne, professor of management, associate dean for faculty affairs and director of the Institute for Leadership Excellence and Development (iLead), currently is serving as interim dean.</p>
<p>The university seeks an experienced and strategic leader with a deep commitment to access and academic excellence to serve as the next dean of the College of Business Administration, who will help preserve and elevate the college’s rich and diverse culture, its ability to evolve and adapt to changes reflected in the local and global business community, and its legacy as a destination of choice for aspiring business leaders. The next dean of the College of Business Administration will take the helm of a college composed of nearly 150 faculty spread across six academic departments, which has grown significantly in stature and size over the last decade.</p>
<p>The dean reports to the provost and is a permanent member of the University Deans Council. <a href="https://www.wittkieffer.com/positionfiles/u2331427/Leadership+Profile+-+Final+-+UIC+CBA+Dean.pdf">Read the full position profile.</a></p>
<p>We have retained the search firm WittKieffer to assist in recruiting candidates, and the <a href="https://adminsearches.uic.edu/current/cba/committee/">search committee</a> is being chaired by Pete Nelson, PhD, dean of the College of Engineering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="p1">Dear colleagues,</p>
<p class="p1">What I find common among many of us who work for UIC is our dedication to its unique mission. Each of us is inspired by a different piece of it.</p>
<p class="p1">GivingTuesday, happening tomorrow, is a day built for all of us to show our support for the piece of UIC’s mission that most inspires and fulfills us. Your contributions on <a href="https://givingtuesday.uic.edu/"><span class="s1">givingtuesday.uic.edu</span></a>, no matter the size, goes immediately to helping a person or initiative to do bigger, bolder work in an area that matters to you.</p>
<p class="p1">The goal on GivingTuesday, as always, is participation. Know that collectively, your donations at all levels make an incredible impact on the good work happening across UIC. Last year, the vast majority of GivingTuesday gifts were under $250. Yet total contributions topped $1 million. And of 1,828 donors who participated, more than 31% were faculty and staff. Of course, <a href="https://go.uic.edu/champion"><span class="s2">there are many ways to participate</span></a> beyond giving.</p>
<p class="p1">If we can meet our GivingTuesday goal of topping 2,000 donors, it will build on a time of incredible momentum at UIC. We could add this feat to record-breaking enrollment and research numbers, a rise in the rankings that matter and the success of our history-making IGNITE Campaign. Here’s a tip: Keep an eye on the leaderboard to see how we’re doing.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m proud to work alongside you each day to support students and faculty, pursue new knowledge, uplift communities and fight for justice and equity. If past GivingTuesdays are any indication, I’m confident tomorrow’s results will be nothing less than remarkable.</p>
<p class="p1">Thank you and go Flames!</p>
<p class="p1">Tom Wamsley<br />Vice Chancellor for Advancement</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">UIC continually reviews and re-evaluates community and internal COVID-19 data to determine the best guidance for our campus community. Although Chicago’s COVID-19 risk level remains low, there has been a slight increase in cases in Chicago, on campus and at UI Health during the past week. There are also other respiratory viruses increasing in the community, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus and influenza.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">UI Health will continue to require universal masking in all buildings that provide patient care.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is strongly recommended to mask in large group settings. If you are ill, stay home from work and get tested for COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear students, faculty and staff, With the fall election season [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>With the fall election season upon us, I am pleased to share the historic news that members of the UIC community will have expanded opportunities for voter participation on campus. Beginning Monday, Oct. 24, UIC will transition from being a university early voting site with three days of voting to being the primary early voting site for the newly drawn City of Chicago 34th Ward.</p>
<p>Voting will take place each day from Oct. 24 through the Nov. 8 general election. The polling place is located in Room 613 in the Tower at the north end of Student Center East and will be open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. While Election Day, Nov. 8, is a university holiday, the polls in Student Center East will remain open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. <strong>Any person who resides in the City of Chicago may vote on campus.</strong> Resources for voters who live outside the city are provided below. Voters are encouraged, but not required, to wear a face mask that covers the mouth and nose.</p>
<p>Participation in the electoral process is a time-honored tradition at UIC. I strongly encourage you to get involved any way you can — by casting your vote, serving as an election judge, attending a debate watch or ballot party, or learning about issues and candidates. Please keep your eye on the website of <a href="https://slce.uic.edu/">Student Leadership and Civic Engagement</a> for breaking news on election-related events and deadlines. For other questions, contact the UIC Office of Government Relations and Advocacy at <a href="mailto:govt@uic.edu">govt@uic.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Go Flames — and go vote!</p>
<p>Javier Reyes</p>
<p>Interim Chancellor</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear students, faculty and staff, Technology Solutions is pleased to [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Technology Solutions is pleased to announce that next month, we will be updating our authentication service as part of our efforts to modernize security and improve the technology experience at UIC. The Shibboleth single sign-on system used to access most university web resources will be updated to utilize the UIC Microsoft login process.</p>
<h3>What is Shibboleth/SSO?</h3>
<p>Single sign-on is an authentication method that allows users to log in with a single ID and password to any of several related, yet independent, software systems. Shibboleth, UIC’s SSO solution, has been connected with a legacy authentication system called Bluestem, recognizable as the <a href="https://help.uillinois.edu/TDClient/37/uic/KB/ArticleDet?ID=2386#bluestem">UIC login page</a>.</p>
<h3>When is it happening?</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Technology Solutions will be making this change Monday, Nov. 21, at 7 a.m.</p>
<h3>How does this impact me?</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning Nov. 21, most university resources, including Blackboard, Google Workspace, Box and LinkedIn Learning, will present you with the <a href="https://help.uillinois.edu/TDClient/37/uic/KB/ArticleDet?ID=2386#ms_adfs">UIC Microsoft login page</a>, recognizable from UIC Microsoft 365 services. You will need to enter your <strong>full UIC email address</strong>, along with your UIC password, to access the resource.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Note:</strong> When using the UIC Microsoft login page, UI Health staff use their UI Health credentials instead of their UIC credentials. With this change, UI Health staff will use their UI Health credentials to access more university resources. Further details will be provided by UI Health administration.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This change reduces the number of different university login pages, helping you ensure that you’re using a legitimate login page.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, this change reduces how often you are prompted for Duo 2-Factor Authentication. For example, with this new unified login process, if you are prompted to authenticate with Duo 2FA when accessing Microsoft 365 at office.uic.edu, and then you access Box at uofi.box.com, you will not be prompted to authenticate with Duo 2FA a second time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some older browsers will not support the new login process, so please review <a href="https://help.uillinois.edu/TDClient/37/uic/KB/ArticleDet?ID=2611">which browsers are compatible with the UIC Microsoft login page</a> to avoid login issues.</p>
<h3>What is not changing?</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some university resources, primarily within individual colleges/units, are using the Bluestem authentication system directly. Those resources will continue using the UIC login page for the time being, but will be transitioned to use the new login process over the coming year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This change will not impact which university resources require Duo 2FA.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">University of Illinois System resources using the <a href="https://help.uillinois.edu/TDClient/37/uic/KB/ArticleDet?ID=2386#enterprise">Enterprise login page</a> are also not impacted by this change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="p1">Dear UIC community:</p>
<p class="p1">The Senate External Relations and Public Service Committee invites you to submit nominations for consideration in awarding honorary degrees at UIC. Honorary degrees are the highest award conferred by UIC. An honorary degree may reward exemplary and extraordinary contributions either to the scholarly or professional world, to public service, or to UIC’s achievements and the ideals of its missions of teaching, research, service and economic development. We welcome nominations of persons of national or international renown within or outside official academic disciplines, which is also the practice with most major institutions of higher education throughout the United States. Some relationship with UIC is desirable but not required for consideration, but in such a case, it is particularly necessary to explain why this individual is deserving of an honorary degree from UIC.</p>
<p class="p1">The approved guidelines for awarding honorary degrees at UIC, including eligibility criteria, nomination procedures, process and timelines <a href="https://uofi.app.box.com/v/HonoraryDegreeGuidelines">can be accessed online</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://commencement.uic.edu/about/history/honorary-degrees/">View a listing of previous honorary degree recipients</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">The deadline for receipt of official nominations and all supporting documents is noon Thursday, Dec. 1, 2022.</p>
<p class="p1">A nomination should be marked &#8220;CONFIDENTIAL: HONORARY DEGREES&#8221; and submitted electronically to Senate Coordinator and Clerk, UIC Office of the Senate, <a href="https://today.uic.edu/?mailpoet_router&amp;endpoint=track&amp;action=click&amp;data=WyIxNDgiLCI5YTM0NWRkMzM0NDM1YTljODk3YWRjYjI4MzliMWIwNCIsIjIwOSIsImRjZjYyMDJhYTIyZSIsZmFsc2Vd"><span class="s1">edooley@uic.edu</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">We encourage nominations from diverse and underrepresented populations, and we would love to see nominations from each UIC college and campus this year.</p>
<p class="p1">Respectfully,</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear UIC Community, It is bittersweet and with profound respect [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear UIC Community,</p>
<p>It is bittersweet and with profound respect I share with you today that Janet Parker, vice chancellor for budget, human resources and financial administration, has announced her retirement, effective Feb. 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Janet has served the University of Illinois Chicago for the past 10 years as our chief financial and budget officer. She currently has responsibility for the oversight of Human Resources, Budget and Financial Analysis, Institutional Research, Purchasing and a variety of leased university-owned facilities. Janet serves as the Board of Trustees-appointed treasurer for Wolcott, Wood and Taylor Inc., and the treasurer for the Chicago Bar Association Condominium Association, a building obtained during acquisition of the law school, UIC’s 16th college, for which she also coordinated many financial and procurement aspects. She currently serves as principal investigator for Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) grants totaling over $100 million, issued by the federal government for COVID-19 financial assistance.</p>
<p>During her tenure at UIC, she navigated the university through the State of Illinois budget impasse in 2016 and 2017, and created the escrow strategy to repay college fund balances that were needed to cover $140 million unfunded state appropriations. She was instrumental in the contract negotiation and implementation of the partnership with Shorelight Education Inc., greatly increasing our enrollment of undergraduate international students. Janet played a critical role in the financial planning for the award-winning public/private (P3) partnership that led to the construction of one of the most unique and innovative learning and residential university buildings in the nation.</p>
<p>Although Janet had originally hoped to retire right around the onset of the pandemic, we are enormously grateful that she made the decision to remain here to guide us through the fiscal challenges that resulted.</p>
<p>Michael Ginsburg, associate vice chancellor for UIC Human Resources, will assume the interim vice chancellor position, effective Feb. 1, 2023, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Michael Moss, associate vice chancellor, budget and financial analysis, will replace Janet as co-chair of the Budget Model Redesign Taskforce, effective Feb. 1, 2023, to ensure continued momentum of that important project.</p>
<p>We wish Janet much success in her retirement. We know she will continue to work tirelessly for UIC up until her very last day, after which I am certain she will be embarking on many new travel adventures in the next phase of her life.</p>
<p>Javier Reyes<br />
Interim Chancellor</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear faculty and staff, Helping the UIC community stay safe [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear faculty and staff,</p>
<p>Helping the UIC community stay safe online is one of our priorities at Technology Solutions. While our Security Team works hard behind the scenes to minimize threats, cybercriminals find new sophisticated and believable ways to trick you, particularly through email and text messages.</p>
<p>In honor of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we wanted to remind you of the common scams targeting UIC faculty and staff:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duo 2-Factor Authentication scam</strong><br />
Scammers will send you Duo 2FA prompts using your leaked or compromised password with the hopes to annoy or trick you into accepting the request. If you receive unsolicited Duo 2FA authentication requests, DO NOT authenticate them. Immediately change your password to protect your account and &#8220;Deny&#8221; the authentication requests.</li>
<li><strong>Email scams (phishing)</strong><br />
Phishing emails are fraudulent emails that try to trick the recipient into entering login credentials on a fake website, opening an attachment or duping you into sharing other sensitive information. These emails can be hard to detect but common scams are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Password notifications</strong> – False emails claiming you requested a password change and prompt you to log in immediately to cancel the request.</li>
<li><strong>Voicemail messages </strong>– Scammers try to trick you into opening an audio attachment or logging into a fake website claiming you have an urgent voicemail so that they can steal your password or trick you into opening a malicious file.</li>
<li><strong>Receipts and invoices </strong>– Scammers posing as popular online retailers, such as Amazon, send emails with a fake receipt or invoice attachment and urge you to review or take action to cancel the order.</li>
<li><strong>Shipping notifications </strong>– Be aware of emails impersonating shipping companies with fake delivery notifications or shipping status alerts similar to receipt and invoice scams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gift card scam</strong><br />
Scammers will pose as university leaders within your own department and send you an urgent request to purchase gift cards. They will often ask that you send photos of the gift cards to a personal email account or via text message. Always verify urgent requests directly using another method, such as a phone call, before taking action. Be wary; oftentimes, the scammer will say that they are at an important meeting and unable to respond if you attempt to contact them directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Criminals are crafty and look for new opportunities to steal information or assets. To learn about other scams, safety tips and to see the 2022 student cybersecurity awareness campaign, visit the <a href="https://it.uic.edu/news-stories/2022-csam-faculty-and-staff/">Cybersecurity Awareness Month webpage</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory security training (coming soon)</strong><br />
The Technology Solutions Security Team will be administering mandatory comprehensive security training conducted by KnowBe4, a leader in security awareness training.</p>
<p>University policy requires all faculty and staff to complete information security awareness training biennially. More details on the biennial training will be sent in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The Technology Solutions Security Team is committed to keeping the UIC community safe from cyberattacks and hopes to raise awareness and emphasize the importance of recognizing malicious email and other potential security events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>Beginning at 7 a.m. Oct. 12, and continuing until 3 p.m. Oct. 14, contractors will be installing signage on the pedestrian bridge connecting UI Hospital and the Outpatient Surgery Center. During this work, Taylor Street will be reduced to a single lane between Hermitage Avenue and Wood Street.</p>
<p>Flaggers will be positioned at the east and west ends of the lane closure to control the flow of traffic. Pedestrian access to the hospital will be maintained, although there will be intermittent sidewalk closures by flaggers on the north side of Taylor Street, just west of the hospital entrance.</p>
<p>Both lanes of Taylor Street will open at 3 p.m. each day during this period.</p>
<p>Please use caution when traveling through this area.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The realignment resulted from an assessment started under the leadership of Rex Tolliver, former vice chancellor for student affairs. Combining Student Affairs units focused on student development, engagement and programming, health and wellness, assessment, operations and business affairs with Academic Affairs units focused on enrollment, registration, advising and student success units creates an integrated organizational structure reflective of students and their personal and academic potential, in and outside of the classroom.

					<description><![CDATA[Dear University of Illinois Chicago community: As we begin to [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear University of Illinois Chicago community:</p>
<p>As we begin to settle into a new academic year, our campuses are once again teeming with a sense of renewed optimism and excitement. We write to remind you of how important it is that we all remain vigilant and make informed decisions that facilitate our own personal safety and well-being and that of your fellow Flames. We will continue to devote significant attention and resources toward a comprehensive approach to safety and security at UIC. That is our promise.</p>
<p>With that in mind, please take a few moments to review the vital information found in our <a href="https://go.uic.edu/CleryReport"><strong>2022 Annual Security and Fire Safety Report</strong></a>. Learn how the university has reinforced its public safety and security practices, bolstered prevention training and adopted technology solutions to improve your safety in and around our communities.</p>
<p>The report is a highly regulated response to directives from the <strong>U.S. Department of Education</strong> under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, otherwise known as the Clery Act. The purpose of the report is to equip you with the information you need to stay safe while at UIC.</p>
<p>A few items you will find in the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy disclosures pertaining to campus safety and security; crime prevention; alcohol and other drug abuse; emergency notifications; and UIC’s program to prevent Violence Against Women Act crimes of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.</li>
<li>Crime statistics for 2021, 2020 and 2019 on Clery Act crimes that occurred on campus (including on-campus student housing facilities), on noncampus property frequently used by students, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to and accessible from each campus.</li>
<li>Fire statistics for 2021, 2020 and 2019 on reported fires that occurred in on-campus student housing facilities, in addition to information on fire safety policies, procedures and systems.</li>
<li>The full text of this report is available online at <a href="https://ready.uic.edu">ready.uic.edu</a>. A print copy may be requested from the Office of Preparedness and Response by contacting cleryhelpdesk@uic.edu.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are all aware that our city is not immune to public safety challenges, as crime and acts of violence have increased nationwide. Recent events in Highland Park and Uvalde, Texas, as well as the senseless gun violence occurring in our neighboring communities, are incomprehensible tragedies. These events have heightened our collective awareness for the need to frequently re-examine our crisis response posture to uncover new areas of concern that should be addressed, new practices that could be adopted, and new approaches to mitigation and prevention. We are committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure the safety of our community.</p>
<p>One of the key factors to personal safety is being aware and prepared. Discuss issues that you consider unsafe with friends, faculty and/or administrators, and avoid situations that appear dangerous or that make you uncomfortable. If unsafe circumstances cannot be changed, leave the area, or call the UIC Police Department at 312-355-5555. The UICPD plays a critical role in supporting the university’s mission and values. Our dedicated and diverse police force works 24 hours a day, seven days a week, interacting with the community and patrolling the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>We also recognize that law enforcement actions are not enough, and we must do more to support the social and behavioral health of the communities within and surrounding the university to address the root causes of violence. We are committed to working in partnership with our students, researchers, professors, clinicians, public health professionals and our local governments to directly confront any safety concerns affecting the campus community that many of our students, staff and family call home.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to review this information and helping us create an environment that is secure, respectful, civil and supportive for all. Together, Flames grow stronger! Let’s all do our part to keep <a href="https://ready.uic.edu/toolkit/uic-safe-app/">UIC SAFE</a>. Have a wonderful semester!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear UIC community:</p>
<p>The University of Illinois System implemented the annual Student Mental Health Symposia in 2020. These symposia serve as “the start of an ongoing effort to address student mental health while emphasizing the role all members of the campus community can play in supporting a caring and nurturing environment that allows students to thrive and reach their full potential.”</p>
<p>As the inaugural assistant vice chancellor for student health and wellness and executive director of the UIC Counseling Center, I am excited to host two town halls following this year’s Mental Health Symposium Keynote, Stacey Pearson-Wharton, PhD. As the new AVC for Student Health and Wellness, I am leading the integration of the counseling center, the wellness center, and the campus recreation center, while working with UIC faculty, staff and students to enhance student health and well-being through a community-oriented and public health grounded approach. Each of the town halls will be an opportunity for you to learn more about a vision for a health-promoting campus community at UIC and for you to share your ideas and suggestions about how we can collectively co-create a health-promoting campus environment in which all UIC students can thrive.</p>
<p>There are two opportunities to participate in a town hall, and livestreaming will be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oct. 3, 5:30-6:30 p.m., Student Center East, Illinois Room, third floor.
<ul>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In-person classes, social activities and modified COVID-19 guidelines continue to provide the best on-campus experience possible. Our public health guidance continues to be adjusted. These decisions are based on our educational setting, current COVID-19 transmission in the community, and protecting the health and well-being of our community. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a reminder, please review current masking protocols, noncompliance procedures and recently updated isolation and quarantine guidance:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Masking </span></b><br />
<span data-contrast="auto">Masks continue to be required in classrooms, lecture centers, research labs, the libraries and learning/success centers, health care settings (including the Counseling Center), and on UIC shuttles and buses. Masking is highly encouraged in other settings, including at events, but it is a choice based on personal risk. </span>Chicago has moved into a low level of transmission, if this is sustained for several weeks masking requirements will be reevaluated.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Instructors/lecturers may take off their mask to lecture when greater than 6 feet from the audience/students.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear new UIC students, faculty and staff:</p>
<p>In accordance with federal guidelines, the following information is provided each semester to inform new students and employees about the UIC Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago has a long-standing commitment to supporting and maintaining a drug-free environment for its students and employees. In keeping with this history, we provide a link below to the current UIC Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy and the University Statement on a Drug-Free Workplace.</p>
<p>The Policy and Resource Guide was developed in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989. The policy describes the health risks and legal sanctions associated with alcohol and other drugs. It outlines the university&#8217;s rule of conduct and disciplinary actions taken against students or employees who violate the policy, and provides university and community resources to help with a drug- or alcohol-related problem.</p>
<p>The AOD Policy represents the university&#8217;s continued commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. Please familiarize yourself with the <a style="color: #d50032;" href="https://wellnesscenter.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2021/08/2021-2022-UIC-AOD-Policy-.pdf"><span style="color: #d50032;">policy</span></a>.</p>
<p>Employees are also encouraged to read the <a style="color: #d50032;" href="https://uofi.app.box.com/s/vraroy6c1jk2h4ojk1218lcnu5xhf2sz"><span style="color: #d50032;">University Statement on a Drug Free Workplace</span></a>. Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 312-996-4857 with any questions. Employees should contact UIC Human Resources at 312-996-0840.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear UIC students, faculty and staff:</p>
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago values and respects of freedom of thought, inquiry, speech and lawful assembly for all members of the university community. The university is committed to a learning environment where the open expression of ideas is valued and celebrated. In addition to supporting the expression of members of our community, the university must also maintain the safety of our campus and protect the rights of others to pursue their work, research and education.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://policies.uic.edu/uic-policy-library/student-affairs/uic-policy-on-open-expression/">Open Expressions Policy</a> frames how we support and protect the right to expression and the constitutionally defined parameter of those rights. This policy applies to both members of the university community and their invited guests. All members of the university community are encouraged to familiarize themselves with this policy.</p>
<p>If members of the university community observe or experience bias at UIC, you can file a report through the <a href="http://go.uic.edu/brt">Bias Reporting Tool</a> and receive support. Reports can be made anonymously through this collaborative tool supported by the Office of Diversity, Equity and Engagement, Office of the Dean of Students, and Office for Access and Equity. For more information on the Bias Reporting Tool and resources related to bias prevention and education, visit <a href="http://go.uic.edu/brt">Bias Reporting and Prevention</a>.</p>
<p>If members of the university community experience unlawful discrimination at UIC, you can file a report through the <a href="https://oae.uic.edu/">Office for Access and Equity reporting website</a>.</p>
<p>We consider the university to be a learning laboratory where students, student organizations, faculty and staff will meet and engage with others that share different opinions and values from their own. We hope that students, faculty and staff approach dialogues across difference with curiosity, positive intent and a willingness to learn.</p>
<p>The Office of the Dean of Students encourages members of the campus community to contact us at <a href="mailto:dos@uic.edu">dos@uic.edu</a> with questions about the <a href="https://policies.uic.edu/uic-policy-library/student-affairs/uic-policy-on-open-expression/">Open Expressions Policy</a>, information about possible violations or for support planning activities that promote open expression.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">We are providing notification from the Chicago Department of Public Health about the risk of monkeypox virus in university settings. The Chicago Department of Public Health has been aware of off-campus events involving university students across Chicago that have led to possible exposures to monkeypox virus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Monkeypox virus causes a painful rash that changes shape throughout the course of the illness, starting from a small lesion (like a pimple) to a fluid-filled lesion (like a blister), to a pus-filled lesion with a divot in the center. Often the rash is accompanied by flu-like symptoms, such as fever and chills, and swollen lymph nodes. It can last for up to three weeks.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Monkeypox virus is spread through close contact with the sores of an infected individual, often through intimate or sexual contact. It is important to know that while most cases of monkeypox so far have occurred in gay and bisexual men, anyone can get monkeypox virus. To reduce risk, it is important to maintain open communication with any intimate partners about your sexual health and limit your intimate activities if you are feeling ill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you have had sexual contact with multiple or anonymous sexual partners over the past few weeks, especially at a large party or event, you should consider getting vaccinated. You should also monitor yourself for symptoms; see a provider and get tested if you have symptoms. Monkeypox vaccination appointments and FAQs are available at <a href="https://hospital.uillinois.edu/primary-and-specialty-care/infectious-diseases/monkeypox">UI Health monkeypox</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear UIC community:</p>
<p>The University of Illinois System implemented the annual Student Mental Health Symposia in 2020. These symposia serve as “the start of an ongoing effort to address student mental health while emphasizing the role all members of the campus community can play in supporting a caring and nurturing environment that allows students to thrive and reach their full potential.”</p>
<p>As the inaugural assistant vice chancellor for student health and wellness and executive director of the UIC Counseling Center, I am excited to host two town halls following this year’s Mental Health Symposium Keynote, Stacey Pearson-Wharton, PhD. As the new AVC for student health and wellness, I am leading the integration of the counseling center, wellness center and campus recreation center, while working with UIC faculty, staff and students to enhance student health and well-being through a community-oriented and public health grounded approach. Each of the town halls will be an opportunity for you to learn more about a vision for a health-promoting campus community at UIC and for you to share your ideas and suggestions about how we can collectively co-create a health-promoting campus environment in which all UIC students can thrive.</p>
<p>Please save the date for the following two opportunities to participate in a town hall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oct. 3, 5:30-6:30 p.m., Student Center East, Illinois Room, third floor.</li>
<li>Oct. 4, 5:30-6:30 p.m., Student Center West, Thompson Room, second floor.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear students, faculty and staff: This Saturday marks National Constitution [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>
<p>This Saturday marks National Constitution Day in Illinois and across the country. On Sept. 17, 1787, delegates to the Constitutional Convention signed the document that was to become the cornerstone of democracy in the United States. In 2004, Congress created an observance, held Sept. 17 each year, to commemorate that historic day and to recognize the contributions of millions of naturalized U.S. citizens past and present.</p>
<p>Every September, UIC celebrates Constitution Day with a lecture from a distinguished civic scholar and a series of engagement opportunities offered by departments around campus, providing a chance for students and professionals interested in government, law and society to meet and network. Join us Monday, Sept. 19, to honor retiring <a href="http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/7T9QWDkQFlg7jPwZqjjS9w~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRlAiuzP0QVaHR0cHM6Ly9wb2xzLnVpYy5lZHUvVwNzcGNCCmMXs6YfY4VldUpSDndhY2xhd0B1aWMuZWR1WAQAAAAE">UIC political science</a> professor Dick Simpson — an authority on political corruption as well as on elections, voting patterns, local government, budgeting and neighborhood empowerment — as he offers solutions to some of the most intractable problems facing American democracy today.</p>
<p>Kindly note that <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/79c54aa3-ab0f-4519-9953-9b4ece14ffef/summary">advance registration</a> for this virtual Alumni Exchange event is required; registered participants will receive a secure Zoom link for the lecture.</p>
<p>I hope you can join us Monday as we celebrate Professor Simpson and his more than 50 years of service to UIC. Learn more about him by checking out UIC today’s <a href="http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/TEGiGiS5GkMMbhZUFJhgMg~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRlAiuzP0RcaHR0cHM6Ly90b2RheS51aWMuZWR1L3JldGlyaW5nLXBvbGl0aWNhbC1zY2llbnRpc3QtZGljay1zaW1wc29uLXJlZmxlY3RzLW9uLTU1LXllYXJzLWF0LXVpYy9XA3NwY0IKYxezph9jhWV1SlIOd2FjbGF3QHVpYy5lZHVYBAAAAAQ~">recent profile</a> of one of the most treasured faculty members in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>In addition, UIC students are invited to join their peers for virtual Constitution Day celebrations and fun Sept. 20, from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m., and Sept. 21, from 9 to 10 p.m. Test your knowledge of the Constitution and win a prize at the same time. No registration is necessary to <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83597847571?pwd=OFZzcHBVQkFVVWFIUFhmczlZY3daUT09#success">join the Zoom events</a>.</p>

<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>Due to a special event at the Dorin Forum Friday, Sept. 16, several adjacent streets and parking facilities will be closed and may cause significant traffic delays for both drivers and pedestrians. Please allow extra time, or avoid the area if possible.</p>
<p>UIC parking lots 6 and 14 will close at 10 p.m. tonight and will reopen at 6 p.m. Friday. Personnel are encouraged to use the Halsted Street Parking Structure. The Maxwell Street parking lot will remain open for UI Health clinic patients and staff and other authorized personnel.</p>
<p>Beginning Friday at 11:30 a.m. and continuing until 5 p.m., the following streets will be closed to vehicular traffic:</p>
<ul>

<li>Halsted Street from Taylor to Maxwell streets.</li>

</ul>
<p>During this time period, partial street closures will also be in effect from 16th Street to Maxwell Street. Please note, street closure hours may change if needed.</p>
<p>Area residents and UIC students, faculty and staff who are on official university business should be prepared to present their UIC/UI Health ID cards in order to travel through these areas. Because of expected traffic delays, please plan your travel accordingly.</p>
<p>The City of Chicago will provide traffic management services in the affected areas. It is expected that some local businesses in these areas will be closed, so you may wish to call before attempting to access them.</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate your cooperation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear UIC students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>This email is a follow up to the <a href="https://today.uic.edu/upcoming-improvements-to-university-website-infrastructure?utm_source=mailpoet&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=vcin%2Bofficial%2B08.03.22">”upcoming improvements to university website infrastructure” communication</a> that was sent Aug. 3, 2022.</p>
<p>Technology Solutions is pleased to announce that Red — the university’s multisite network built on WordPress — was successfully migrated to Pantheon’s cloud-based servers as of 3 p.m. Monday, Sept. 5.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything I need to know or do?</strong></p>
<p>With a migration of this magnitude and the additional element of adopting a new technology, some issues have been reported with Red sites. Site admins and editors should review the following identified issues:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Content on some Red websites is missing.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Some site owners have reported missing content after the migration. If this has happened to your site, Technology Solutions is able to restore the site to the state it was in as of noon Friday, Sept. 2. Red site <a href="http://it.uic.edu/report-a-problem.">restoration requests can be submitted online</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Login-protected pages need to be re-enabled.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>The migration brought a change in the authentication method for password-protected pages on Red websites, which requires a one-time adjustment to re-enable authentication for protected pages. Site admins can follow the instructions at &#8220;<a href="https://help.uillinois.edu/TDClient/37/uic/KB/ArticleDet?ID=2571">How do I re-enable a login page in my Red website?</a>&#8220;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During these next two weeks, Technology Solutions will be focusing efforts on finalizing the migration and restoring databases for sites with missing content.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Starting Monday, Sept. 26, Technology Solutions will be reallocating resources to focus on Red improvement requests and other priority projects. After this date, it will no longer be possible to restore a Red website to its state prior to the migration, and any missing or lost content will be irretrievable.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A separate email communication has been sent to Red administrators, users, authors and contributors notifying them of the identified bugs and site recall expiration date, and we encourage members of the UIC community to report any issues or problems.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I report and/or find reported issues with Red sites?</strong><br />
The IT @ UIC <a href="http://it.uic.edu/service-status">service status page</a> contains reported issues. Issues and <a href="http://it.uic.edu/report-a-problem">problems can be reported online</a>.</p>
<p>This migration not only transforms the future of Red sites, but also helps us establish a truly collaborative developer community where we can discuss ideas, develop solutions and innovate.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello UIC students: As you begin a new academic year [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello UIC students:</p>
<p>As you begin a new academic year at UIC, we are excited to welcome you all back to campus and want to take a moment to emphasize the importance of being a good neighbor, whether you live on or off campus. It is important for you to take a moment to reflect on your place within the university and the neighboring community. Through the <a style="color: #d50032;" title="U&amp;I Care link" href="https://dos.uic.edu/student-assistance/uicare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #d50032;">U&amp;I Care</span></a> program offered by the Office of the Dean of Students, please explore your responsibilities with some tips on being a good neighbor:</p>
<p><strong>Meeting community expectations</strong><br />
As a member of the UIC community, you are expected to act in accordance with university policies and local, state and federal laws. You are responsible not only for the intent behind your behavior, but also for the impact of your actions.</p>
<p>Expectations for student behavior, both on and off campus, are outlined in the <a style="color: #d50032;" title="Student Disciplinary Policy link" href="https://dos.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/262/2021/09/Student-Disciplinary-Policy-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #d50032;">Student Disciplinary Policy</span></a>. Additional <a href="https://dos.uic.edu/community-standards/personal-community-integrity/being-a-good-neighbor">information about being a good neighbor is available online</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing communication</strong><br />
We encourage you to safely introduce yourself to your neighbors, learn their names and exchange phone numbers. Be friendly and say hello or acknowledge your neighbor when you see them. Be respectful and responsive to their concerns and engage in dialogue if a problem arises.</p>
<p><strong>Attending or hosting social gatherings</strong><br />
It is natural for a student to want to invite friends over and host a social gathering; however, when a large number of &nbsp;uninvited guests start showing up, this can lead to a disturbance. Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when hosting a social gathering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inform your neighbors that you will be hosting a social event in your residence. Encourage them to reach out to you if the noise level gets too high or any other issue occurs.</li>
<li>Be mindful of the noise you are causing. If you can hear noise coming from outside of your residence, your neighbors can as well, and it is too loud.</li>
<li>Establish a reasonable time for your gathering to end. Remember that not everyone is on the same schedule as you and your neighbors may have jobs or families to tend to in the morning.</li>
<li>Inform guests to remain on your property and not on your neighbor’s property.</li>
<li>Make sure your guests are disposing of their trash appropriately. Provide the correct and necessary amount of trash bins.</li>
<li>Keep in mind you are responsible for your guests’ actions and behaviors as well as your own.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parking</strong><br />
Residents and guests should abide by all parking ordinances and not block any driveways or parking spaces.</p>
<p>We’re confident that with these simple tips you will be an exemplary neighbor. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Fred McCall<br />
Associate Vice Chancellor/Interim Dean of Students</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>The <a href="http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/ZMRZUbLRmYiKMtXxxJlPHg~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRj562TP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS51aWMuZWR1L3RlYWNoaW5nLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWluaXRpYXRpdmUvVwNzcGNCCmIBkygFYpvlM8JSDWNpbmR5QHVpYy5lZHVYBAAAAAQ~">Teaching Sustainability Initiative</a> is open to all UIC faculty, and applications for its 2023 cohort are due Dec. 2.</p>
<p>Currently in its fourth year, the TSI course development program is hosted by the Office of Planning, Sustainability and Project Management and the Chancellor’s Committee on Sustainability and Energy. The program is intended to intentionally expand UIC’s sustainability course offerings to all students. Since its inception, its community has grown to 45 TSI fellows, and TSI-incentivized courses have reached over 3,000 students to deliver an innovative sustainability curriculum. Cohorts are limited to 20 fellows, and faculty from all disciplines are encouraged to apply.</p>
<p>The TSI program begins with a one-day workshop in which faculty from all subject areas will receive an overview on how to adapt and/or create curricula to include sustainability concepts. The workshop explores how sustainability can be meaningfully integrated into UIC classrooms and how faculty can access a network of experienced instructors who can provide assistance and feedback to formulate a dynamic syllabus and curriculum.</p>
<p>Teaching Sustainability Initiative program objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining sustainability for your field.</li>
<li>Identifying a framework for curricula, developing learning outcomes and exploring peer syllabi from prior TSI fellows.</li>
<li>Exploring UIC’s own infrastructure through its Climate Action Implementation Plan strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty or instructors of record will receive financial support for their participation. For a program overview, stipend information and to apply, please visit the <a href="http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/ZMRZUbLRmYiKMtXxxJlPHg~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRj562TP0RCaHR0cHM6Ly9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS51aWMuZWR1L3RlYWNoaW5nLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWluaXRpYXRpdmUvVwNzcGNCCmIBkygFYpvlM8JSDWNpbmR5QHVpYy5lZHVYBAAAAAQ~">program website.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago reaffirms its commitment to providing a safe environment for minors who are participating in UIC programs both on and off campus as well as virtual programs. The <a href="https://policies.uic.edu/uic-policy-library/human-resources/protection-of-minors/">University of Illinois Protection of Minors policy</a> outlines requirements that members of the university community (UIC personnel, UIC volunteers and UIC contractors) must take in order to provide a safe environment.</p>
<p>As reflected in our university’s procedures, units shall not allow any adult person who is responsible for the supervision of minors, or whose duties would require close contact with minors (who are not enrolled or accepted for enrollment at the university), to participate in a university program or activity designed to include minors without verifying that the person has undergone a criminal background check and a sex offender registry check within the past two years. Please review the <a href="https://uofi.app.box.com/s/ntnq8cyashcr5jf1f8q3joqq4f93fiej">procedures</a> for additional information about this requirement.</p>
<p>UIC also requires that units planning or conducting programs or activities designed to include minors who are not enrolled at the university report such activities to the UIC Protection of Minors Office on the <a href="https://uofi.app.box.com/s/s0uufwcat7bmlrz0ymhrlsac36tdy9lx">Protection of Minors Event form</a>.</p>
<p>Individuals working with or responsible for minors are expected to comply with the policy and submit the appropriate documentation in a timely manner.</p>
<p>As we begin the fall semester, we want to offer you a tool to ensure that anyone associated with programs for minors is aware of the policy and requirements. We encourage everyone to view or review the five-minute video entitled &#8220;<a href="https://hr.uic.edu/employees/protection-of-minors/">Protecting Minors on Campus</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact UIC’s Protection of Minors Coordinator, Joanna Wolek, at <a href="mailto:uicpom@uic.edu">uicpom@uic.edu</a>, or visit the <a href="https://hr.uic.edu/employees/protection-of-minors/">Protection of Minors webpage</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear students, faculty and staff, To meet state and federal [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>To meet state and federal regulations, the OVCAS Environmental Health and Safety Office, in coordination with UIC Police and Facilities Management, will conduct evacuation drills for buildings on the Chicago campus beginning Wednesday, Sept. 7, through Friday, Sept. 9, during the hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day.</p>
<p>The hospital, medical clinics and UIC School of Law will not participate. Also, the following list of buildings will not participate as they have already participated in an evacuation drill or already have a scheduled evacuation drill for the current year:</p>
<ul>
<li>University Hall.</li>
<li>All student centers.</li>
<li>Student recreation centers.</li>
<li>All residence halls.</li>
<li>College of Pharmacy.</li>
<li>School of Public Health West.</li>
<li>School of Public Health and Psychiatric Institute.</li>
<li>2242 W. Harrison St.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other buildings will have an evacuation drill on one of the above dates.</p>
<p>A building evacuation goes into effect in the event of a fire or other emergency that requires all occupants to leave the building to ensure their safety. Please read the following information regarding building evacuations.</p>
<p>Please refer to your building-specific Emergency Action Plan and Emergency Evacuation Route Maps to see the evacuation routes and designated Evacuation Assembly Area where building occupants should go immediately after leaving the building after an evacuation due to fire or another emergency. Evacuation maps are posted by the main elevator lobby of each floor in all buildings, and in the main lobby of buildings that do not have an elevator. In addition, please review the building evacuation guidelines below:</p>
<p><strong>Building Evacuation Guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the two nearest exits for your area, which are shown on the Emergency Evacuation Route maps. It&#8217;s important to know two exit paths should smoke, fire or other hazards block one.</li>
<li>Identify the location of the nearest fire alarm pull station if they exist in your building. This is the best way to alert others about a fire.</li>
<li>Follow instructions of emergency services personnel, including UIC Police, Chicago Fire Department, EHSO or other responding agencies.</li>
<li>When the fire alarm is activated, leave immediately through the nearest and safest exit. Do not attempt to use elevators.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re not able to evacuate without assistance, proceed to the nearest stairwell and wait there to be evacuated by a member of the Chicago Fire Department. Once you are in the stairwell, use a cell phone to call UIC Police at 312-355-5555. Be prepared to tell them your exact location, name, cell phone number and any other information needed to assist with your evacuation.</li>
<li>As you evacuate, close, but do not lock, all doors to slow the spread of smoke and fire. Once outside, move to the building&#8217;s Evacuation Assembly Area.</li>
<li>Once safely outside, call UIC Police at 312-355-5555 to alert them about the activated fire alarm. Be prepared to tell them the name and address of the building.</li>
<li>Do not reenter the building until authorized emergency personnel give the &#8220;all clear&#8221; signal.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very important to treat each fire alarm as a true emergency. It is safer to evacuate and find out there is no emergency than to remain in the building and find out there is one.</p>
<p>To learn more about your Emergency Action Plan, we encourage you to review the short online training course “UIC Emergency Action Plan Training.” If you would like to help the campus community by serving as a Floor Evacuation Monitor, please complete the online training “Emergency Evacuation Assistance Training for Floor Monitors.”</p>
<p>The building-specific Emergency Action Plans, Emergency Evacuation Route Maps and the online training courses can all be found at the Environmental Health and Safety website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ehso.uic.edu/fire-safety/building-specific-emergency-action-plans/">Emergency Action Plans and Emergency Evacuation Route Maps.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ehso.uic.edu/training/">Online training courses.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions regarding evacuation procedures, please contact UIC Fire Marshal <a href="mailto:firemarshal@uic.edu">Mark Gaunky</a>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear students, faculty and staff, After navigating the last two [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>After navigating the last two challenging years, it has been heartwarming to see the campus come alive again with the return of students, faculty and staff. We are grateful for our UIC community: a community that reflects our culturally rich city and cares about the well-being of all its members. Equity and inclusion are essential to UIC’s mission of advancing access to excellence and success in academic programs, research and health care. The Office for Access and Equity proudly reaffirms our campus commitment to creating and maintaining an equitable, inclusive and accessible environment.</p>
<p>OAE is responsible for developing and implementing the university’s <a href="https://oae.uic.edu/ah/academic-hiring-process/affirmativeactionplanpolicystatement/">Affirmative Action Plan</a>. This work prioritizes diversifying our faculty and staff by increasing underrepresented populations. As part of this commitment, OAE seeks to ensure that all aspects of employment remain free from discrimination. Cultivating a workforce composed of members from diverse backgrounds, cultures, perspectives and abilities makes UIC stronger and better positioned to serve the needs of our students and community.</p>
<p>OAE strives to create an inclusive environment that promotes mutual respect among one another. One component of building an inclusive campus involves positive daily interactions with those around us. OAE contributes to this goal by maintaining the university’s <a href="https://oae.uic.edu/policies/nondiscrimination-policy-statement/">Nondiscrimination Statement</a><u>,</u> which prohibits unlawful discrimination and harassment based on protected classifications.</p>
<p>OAE is also responsible for ensuring campus compliance related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p>OAE’s ADA Coordinator oversees the <a href="https://oae.uic.edu/policies/americans-with-disabilities-act-employee-accommodation-policy/">Employee Accommodation Policy</a> and supports employees with accommodation requests. The <a href="https://drc.uic.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a> facilitates student accommodation requests.&nbsp; The Director of IT Accessibility manages the accessibility of UIC&#8217;s information communication technology and digital resources.</p>
<p>While we understand the importance of ensuring university compliance with federal and state legislation, OAE also values moving beyond compliance toward a culture that is inclusive, welcoming and universally accessible. Through Dispute Resolution Services, OAE offers resources to help address interpersonal and group conflict to create a safe and productive environment.</p>
<p>OAE looks forward to partnering with our students, faculty and staff to continue our efforts to strengthen our community.</p>

<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>After a competitive national search, we are pleased to announce that Andy Mitchell will become UIC’s next assistant vice chancellor and director of sustainability. He will assume his new role Sept. 1.</p>
<p>We are grateful that Andy will be able to onboard with Cindy Klein-Banai, who currently holds the position and will retire at the end of September. We also want to acknowledge and thank Cindy for all she has done for the university during her tenure. She will leave UIC knowing that she has launched UIC on the path to becoming a Carbon Neutral, Zero Waste, Net Zero Water, and Biodiverse campus and will share that rich history with Andy as he joins UIC.</p>
<p>Andy earned a BA in Environmental Studies from Washington University in St. Louis and an MBA from the University of Notre Dame. He began his career at the pioneering sustainable apparel company Patagonia. He then transitioned into the clean-energy field and has held leadership positions at start-ups, government agencies and Fortune 500 tech companies. He also served as a post-graduate fellow in the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, where he partnered with leading organizations and universities to integrate clean-energy technology in commercial buildings.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Andy has delivered long-term, complex sustainability projects for energy utilities and government clients, including universities. He is known as a consensus builder who is able to form partnerships that move initiatives forward. As the assistant vice chancellor and director of sustainability, Andy will continue to leverage and build upon his technical knowledge and consensus-building skills to advance UIC’s climate commitments and Climate Action Implementation Plan.</p>
<p>Please join us in officially welcoming Andy to UIC.</p>
<p>John Coronado<br />Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services</p>
<p>Dave Taeyaerts<br />Associate Vice Chancellor of Planning, Sustainability and Project Management &amp; Campus Architect</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/741994843">Welcome back, UIC students | Fall 2022</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user157944415">This is UIC</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>Welcome to a new chapter of your UIC journey! I hope you are as excited as I am to begin this new semester. It is always energizing to have our community back on campus after the summer break.</p>
<p>The excitement and anticipation for the academic year was palpable as I joined faculty and staff to welcome students and their families during move-in and new student convocation. The heartfelt conversations and laughs reminded me of my freshman year of college. It was a time filled with asking questions, listening and learning, and creating lifelong connections and friendships that still guide me today. I hope you enter this semester with a newfound curiosity and desire to embrace new lessons and connections.</p>
<p>Through those lessons and partnerships, UIC continues to gain momentum as we experience records all over the university in research, fundraising, athletics, state support and more. This is a testament to you and your contributions. Thank you for what you are doing to make sure UIC shines brightly for all to see. Let’s continue to dream of the possibilities.</p>
<p>I encourage you to make the most of your experience by taking advantage of all UIC offers, from <a href="https://communitycollaboration.uic.edu/">community engagement</a> to the <a href="https://theatreandmusic.uic.edu/">performing arts</a> to <a href="https://studentsuccess.uic.edu/">advancing student success</a> to <a href="https://uicflames.com/">firing up the Flames at games</a>.</p>
<p>At Chicago’s largest and only public research institution, you will be rewarded with world-class teaching, research and learning experiences anchored in social justice and a diverse network of supporters — friends, professors, alumni and colleagues — who believe education changes our communities in and beyond Chicago for the better. Your UIC journey starts today. Let’s make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>Go Flames!</p>
<p>Javier Reyes<br>Interim Chancellor</p>
