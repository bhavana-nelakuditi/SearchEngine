Data Mining and Text Mining
</H1>
</center>

<!-- <center>
<h3>Taught Online Asynchronously
<br>
Using <a href="https://uic.blackboard.com">Blackboard</a> and <a href="https://uic.zoom.us/"> Zoom </a>
</H3>

<H3> Course Objective </h3>
<p>This course has three objectives. First, to provide students with a solid background in the <b>classic data mining and machine learning techniques</b> and to introduce the <b>latest research topics</b> (e.g., <b>out-of-distribution (novelty) detection, learning after model deployment, and lifelong/continual learning</b>). Second, to ensure that students are able to read, and critically evaluate data mining research papers. Third, to ensue that students are able to implement and to use some of the important data mining and text mining algorithms. 

<p> <b>Think and Ask!</b> If you have questions about any topic or assignment, DO ASK me, TA or 
your classmates for help, I am here to make the course 
understood. DO NOT delay your questions. There is no such thing as a 
stupid question. The only obstacle to learning is laziness. </p>

<!-- <h3>Online Platforms </h3>
<p> We will mainly use <a href="https://uic.blackboard.com">Blackboard</a> and <a href="https://uic.zoom.us/">Zoom</a> for teaching and learning. Please get yourself familarized with the systems. </p>
-->

<!--<p>This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. The class pages are given below. </p> -->

<H3> Rules and Policies </H3> 
<uL>
<li> <b>Statute of limitations</b>: No grading questions or complaints, no matter how justified, will be listened to one week after the item in question has been returned. 
<li> <b>Cheating</b>: Cheating will not be tolerated. All work you submitted must be entirely your own. Any suspicious similarities between students' work (this includes, exams and program) will be recorded and brought to the attention of the Dean. The MINIMUM penalty for any student found cheating will be to receive a 0 for the item in question, and dropping your final course grade one letter. The MAXIMUM penalty will be expulsion from the University. 
<li> <b>Late submission</b>: Late submission of assignment or quiz will not be accepted unless it is due to some extraordinary circumstances.
