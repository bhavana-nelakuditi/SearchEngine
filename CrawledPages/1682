<p>David Martinez is the 2022 recipient of the Merit Award from the University of Illinois Chicago’s Division of Specialized Care for Children.</p>
<p>The award recognizes exceptional employees for outstanding dedication and service to Illinois children with special healthcare needs and their families.</p>
<p>Martinez is a care coordinator in the Chicago Central Office. In this role, he helps families develop personalized care plans for their children’s unique needs and connects them to the right services and resources.</p>
<p>“David has a remarkable ability to partner with our participant families and empower them to help reach their full potential,” DSCC Executive Director Thomas F. Jerkovitz said. “He works with families from a variety of cultural backgrounds and helps them feel understood and able to navigate the systems involved in their child’s care.”</p>
<p>His teammates say Martinez has a talent for helping families and working magic in situations where others might not see a way.</p>
<p>“He is culturally sensitive, proactive and able to put himself in other people’s shoes so that he can better understand their situation and how best to partner with them to find a solution,” said Patricia Perez, assistant director of research and practice initiative and former Chicago Central regional manager.</p>
<p>Martinez is a licensed clinical social worker. He grew up in El Salvador and studied criminal justice after coming to the United States.</p>
<p>He provided substance abuse programs at the Cook County Jail before deciding to pursue social work. This decision stemmed from his desire to help others and make an impact on families as early as possible.</p>
<p>Martinez worked in mental health before joining DSCC in April 2016. He says he is honored to work for DSCC and with his amazing colleagues and managers in the Chicago Central office.</p>
<p>“Building strong relationships with my co-workers and the families we serve energizes me every single day,” Martinez said. “Our families’ needs go beyond just medical. Every day is an opportunity to look at a situation from all different aspects and find a solution that can meet their needs. Sometimes it’s as simple as just listening.”</p>
<p>Martinez said his DSCC career has helped him learn about many different cultures and that care coordination is not one-size-fits-all.</p>
<p>“Meeting the family where they are – that’s my starting point,” Martinez said. “When I’m meeting with families, I tell them we are a team.”</p>
<p>Martinez has helped achieve many successful outcomes for his participant families. In early 2022, he secured a $36,000 grant through the Guaranteed Rate Foundation to purchase and install a vehicle wheelchair lift in a participant family’s van and to make their bathroom wheelchair accessible.</p>
<p>But Martinez says his proudest achievements are the relationships he builds with families.</p>
<p>“It would be impossible for me to deliver my passion in social work without having a relationship with families and open communication,” Martinez said. “To be able to talk to families on a monthly basis and help them navigate through issues in life, that is my biggest accomplishment — having the trust the families place in me and DSCC.”</p>
<p>Our DSCC team nominated a total of 12 of our colleagues for this year’s Merit Award. As the winner, Martinez receives a Merit Award memento, a $2,500 award and recognition from the executive director.</p>
<p>The other 2022 nominees are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Melissa Croft, Home Care Enrollment Specialist, Lombard Regional Office.</li>
<li>Christina “Tina” Glim, Care Coordinator, Mokena Regional Office.</li>

<p><strong>Dilip Pandey, MD, PhD, FAHA</strong><br />
Associate Professor<br />
University of Illinois at Chicago<br />
Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Enhancing self-management and quality of life for adults with Epilepsy: PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy at UIC&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction<br />
</strong> People with epilepsy have diverse social backgrounds and educational skillsets; therefore, self-management education for improving their condition is challenging. The PAUSE study evaluated mobile technology-based personalized epilepsy self-management education intervention in improving self-management behaviors, epilepsy outcome expectations, quality of life and personal impact of epilepsy in adults with epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology<br />
</strong> UIC Institutional Review Board approved PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy. Between October 2015 and March 2019, 112 people with epilepsy were recruited at the UI Health epilepsy outpatient clinic and consented to participate.<br />
An Android-based application to provide tailored self-management education intervention was developed for PAUSE. An individualized eight-to-12 week education intervention, utilizing an internet-enabled computer tablet application with download customized to patient-specific educational needs from Epilepsy.com, was provided to the study participants. Participants progressed the learning modules of individualized educational program at their own pace and returned the study computer tablet at the end of intervention period.</p>
<p>Validated self-reported questionnaires were used to obtain outcome measures. Participants were assessed at baseline, the first follow-up at completion of the intervention, and the second follow-up at least three months after the first follow-up.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br />
</strong> There were significant improvements in all self-management behaviors, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, quality of life and personal impact of epilepsy measures from baseline to first follow-up. This study showed feasibility of a mobile-based personalized epilepsy self-management intervention in improving self-management skills and behavior, quality of life for people with epilepsy in clinical settings. This underscores a greater need for a community-based trial to test the effectiveness of personalized self-management education, such as PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy, in broader settings specifically for the unique needs of the hard-to-reach and hard-to-treat population of people with epilepsy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear colleagues, Last spring, we invited proposals for planning awards [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>Last spring, we invited proposals for planning awards to develop a small number of new university research institutes at UIC. We were overwhelmed by the many outstanding proposals submitted, representing 600 faculty and every college.</p>
<p>The Executive Cabinet and OVCR engaged leadership from the Faculty Senate Executive Committee and Faculty Senate Research Subcommittee to ensure proposals went through a rigorous review process.  Senate leaders developed a rubric for determining a fair and thorough assessment. The Executive Cabinet, OVCR, Faculty Senate Research Subcommittee and other strategic campus leaders, faculty and researchers who were not represented on any submitted proposal then reviewed and scored proposals, ultimately yielding a short list of finalists.</p>
<p>We are delighted to announce four proposals have been selected for further development. These teams may receive up to $2 million each over the next four years to expand interdisciplinary research efforts that could not be achieved by any one individual, department, college or discipline, and create collective research efforts that are greater than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p><strong>Addiction and Mental Health: “Addictions in Context, Advancing Interventions,”</strong> led by faculty from Applied Health Sciences, CCTS, College of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Jane Addams College of Social Work and School of Public Health.</p>
<p><strong>Energy and the Environment: “Advanced Materials for Green Energy Sustainability,”</strong> led by faculty from College of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the Institute for Environmental Science and Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Functional Materials Sciences: “Functional and Regenerative Materials,”</strong> led by faculty from College of Dentistry, College of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and College of Medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Sciences: “Translational Vision Science and Technology,”</strong> led by faculty from College of Dentistry, College of Engineering, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Medicine and College of Pharmacy.</p>
<p>We also received many impressive proposals for research in the broad topics of data science and health informatics. While meritorious, some of these projects were overlapping or complementary in both topic areas and faculty. An Institute Planning Award will be supported on these topics, but further facilitated discussion to refine the scope of the project and the team of investigators is pending.</p>
<p>The creativity and breadth of scope in the pool of submitted proposals were energizing. We want to convey how much we appreciate all efforts toward building interdisciplinary teams among our campus colleagues to advance research at UIC. OVCR research leaders are already working to identify alternative approaches to secure external funding for some of the many terrific proposals that cannot be supported by the budget of this program.</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="https://research.uic.edu/institute-planning-awards">the Institute Planning Awards website</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Congratulations to those selected to move forward!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Arthington Mall Plaza is the first SITES certification for UIC and the University of Illinois System]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.sustainablesites.org/node/8497">Arthington Mall Plaza</a> has been certified by the Sustainable SITES Initiative. This is the first SITES certification for UIC and the University of Illinois System, and only the 10th SITES recognition in higher education nationwide.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sustainablesites.org/">Sustainable SITES Initiative</a> offers a comprehensive rating system designed to distinguish sustainable landscapes, measure their performance and elevate their value. It is used in private and public sectors all around the world. Just as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Rating has transformed the built environment, SITES transforms land development and use and believes these types of certifications are critical to ensure projects meet the highest standards.</p>
<p>Arthington Mall Plaza is a central crossroads on the UIC campus and is located directly outside of Student Center West in the Illinois Medical District. The plaza was renovated in 2020 from a stark paved courtyard in need of repair into a vibrant and welcoming outdoor space that encourages gathering, mitigates stormwater runoff, and provides critical urban habitat for pollinators and other species.</p>
<p>“Obtaining SITES certification is one of many third-party collaborations, highlighting the importance of sustainability here at UIC,” said Carly Provost-Rizor, director of grounds services.</p>
<p>The renovation was a joint effort between UIC, the National Fish Wildlife Foundation and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. NFWF and MWRD generously provided $442,000 in funding for the project. The renovation included an intensive landscaping process guided by the <a href="https://sustainability.uic.edu/plans/uicclimatecommitments/">UIC Climate Commitments</a>, the <a href="https://sustainability.uic.edu/green-campus/grounds/green-stormwater-infrastructure/arthington-mall-plaza/">Urban Transformation 2.0: Green Stormwater Infrastructure Implementation Plan</a> and the <a href="https://cppm.uic.edu/planning/2018-implementation-plan/">UIC Master Plan</a>.</p>
<p>“UIC’s Climate Action Implementation Plan is an invaluable tool. This resource guides our sustainability and SITES certification goals, both of which are key components of every major landscape project,” Provost-Rizor said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Beth Richie receives $250,000 for work cultivating and nurturing movements for justice and freedom]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>University of Illinois Chicago professor Beth Richie is among a select group of 10 progressive academics to be named to the latest cohort of the Marguerite Casey Foundation’s<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.caseygrants.org/freedom-scholars">Freedom Scholars</a>, a<strong> </strong>group of scholars leading research and engaged in organizing that advances a racial and economic justice agenda.</p>

<p>Now in its third year, the Freedom Scholars honor provides a one-time award of $250,000 to each recipient to support their work.</p>



<p>Richie, UIC professor and head of criminology, law and justice and professor of Black studies, has conducted four decades of scholarly and activist work focused on the ways that race, ethnicity and social position affect the experience of violence and criminalization, particularly the experiences of Black women and gender non-conforming people. She discusses the importance of ideas and their impact on culture in a <a href="https://www.caseygrants.org/2022-freedom-scholars/beth-e-richie-phd">video</a> from the foundation.</p>



<p>Her current work is at the nexus of race, criminalization and gender violence. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am working on projects in support of criminalized survivors — women and other people who have experienced physical, sexual, and emotional harm from individuals, community institutions and state agencies who are then punished for their attempts to resist or protect themselves,” she said. “This work includes a new research project that documents the extent and nature of the incarceration of survivors of violence and activist work on grassroots campaigns to free people from the long reach of the criminal legal system.”</p>



<p>Richie also teaches at Stateville Correctional Center and is leading an effort to begin an educational program at Logan Correctional Facility. She is the convener of the UIC Abolition Teaching and Learning Network, a group of faculty, students and staff who are working on campus to ensure that incarcerated and formerly incarcerated students have the benefit of a college education and that the campus is accessible to those impacted by mass criminalization.</p>



<p>All of this work is guided by a commitment to abolition feminism and anti-racist strategies for justice, where harm is addressed without the violence of the carceral state, said Richie, who has been at UIC since 1997.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The recognition as a Freedom Scholar will advance that work, building institutional capacity on campus, expanding access to legal and educational services in prisons, challenging patriarchal and racist policies that harm survivors, creating transformative justice and community-based solutions to gender violence and building a world where freedom and justice prevail,” she said.</p>



<p>Her latest publication, “Abolition. Feminism. Now.,” a book she co-authored with Angela Y. Davis, Gina Dent and Erica Meiners, was published earlier this year.&nbsp; Among her other published works is “Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence and America’s Prison Nation,” which chronicles the evolution of the contemporary anti-violence movement during the time of mass incarceration in the United States. Her book “Compelled to Crime: The Gender Entrapment of Black Battered Women” is taught in college classrooms and is cited in the popular press for its original arguments concerning race, gender and crime.</p>



<p>Richie’s work has been supported by grants from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the National Institute for Justice and the National Institute of Corrections.</p>



<p>Richie’s previous honors include the Audre Lorde Legacy Award from the Union Institute, The Advocacy Award from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, The Visionary Award from the Violence Intervention Project and the UIC Woman of the Year Award. Next year, she will be designated as a UIC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences distinguished professor.</p>



<p>She is the second UIC scholar to earn the Freedom Scholar honor. In 2020, UIC historian Barbara Ransby was among the inaugural recipients of the award, which was established to enhance the financial resources available to scholars leading abolitionist, Black, feminist, queer, radical and anti-colonialist studies.</p>



<p>“Through their research, these scholars provide critical insight to social justice leaders and encourage all of us to radically reimagine a democracy, economy and society animated by liberation,” Carmen Rojas, president and CEO of the Marguerite Casey Foundation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear UIC students: The Spring 2023 CTA U-PASS program will [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear UIC students:</p>
<p>The Spring 2023 CTA U-PASS program will be similar to the fall semester. All students that set their opt-in status in the fall 2022 semester will have that status carried over to the spring 2023 semester. Students that did not change their status in the fall will remain at the default status of opt-out. We encourage all students to review their current status to confirm it is set correctly <a href="https://go.uic.edu/spring_upass">here</a>. If you do not wish to utilize the U-PASS benefit, there is no action to take.</p>
<p>For spring 2023, the CTA U-PASS will be available for any student (undergraduate/professional/graduate) taking six or more credits.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Spring U-PASS will be active from Jan. 4–May 10 (dates for the College of Medicine are Dec. 29-Apr. 27, and the College of Dentistry is Dec. 28-May 3).</li>
<li>The deadline to opt-in for the Spring U-PASS is Jan. 29, 2023, at 11:59 p.m.</li>
<li>After Jan. 29, the status cannot change for the duration of the spring semester.</li>
<li>Students who drop below part-time status prior to the add/drop deadline will have their U-PASS deactivated.</li>
<li>A mandatory fee of $163 ($175 for College of Medicine) will be applied to student accounts after the start date and is nonrefundable after the deadline.</li>
<li>Students that opt-out may see the U-PASS fee assessed on their university bill, but that charge will be reversed within 7-10 business days. (There will be no fee removed if students opt-out before the fee is assessed to the student account.)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://go.uic.edu/spring_upass">Confirm or make changes</a> to your status for the Spring 2023 U-PASS benefit online. Students obtaining a new U-PASS for Spring 2023 may request delivery at the same link. For students with existing U-PASS cards, the standard policies on lost/replacement cards will still be enforced.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rob Dixon<br />
Interim Vice Chancellor and Vice Provost for Student Affairs</p>

Romanucci will be the keynote speaker for the 2022 undergraduate ceremony. Photo provided.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The commencement speaker for the undergraduate ceremony will be Antonio M. Romanucci, a national civil rights and personal injury attorney and co-founding partner of Romanucci &amp; Blandin, LLC. Romanucci is a graduate of the former The John Marshall Law School, which was acquired by the university in 2019 and renamed the UIC School of Law.</p>



<p>Starting as a Cook County public defender, he has progressed to being one of the leading civil rights attorneys in the country. He was named the No. 1 civil rights lawyer in 2022 by Leading Lawyers and was selected as<em> </em>Chicago Lawyer magazine’s 2021 Person of the Year. Additionally, he was recently recognized by Chicago Magazine<em> </em>on their ‘New Power 30’ list for his many contributions to the Chicago community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Romanucci is considered the “architect” of the historic civil rights lawsuit and settlement against the City of Minneapolis while co-representing the estate of George Floyd. His national presence is on behalf of many who have suffered due to corporate or individual negligence and his cases include those who lost loved ones on a Boeing 737 Max aircraft, those who were made sick by ethylene oxide emissions in Willowbrook, Illinois, and victims of mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, Las Vegas and Highland Park, Illinois.</p>



<p>He is active in a number of professional associations, such as the American Association for Justice, as well as civic and charitable organizations for children, including St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, where he was honorary chair of the annual fundraising gala in Chicago in 2020.</p>



<p>Romanucci works to educate the next generation by sharing his experiences as an attorney advocating for plaintiffs and for civil justice in and out of the courtroom. He shares this message as he speaks on college campuses, to fellow lawyers, bar associations and community groups. Romanucci has been a guest lecturer to students at the UIC School of Law as well as a speaker at other UIC events, including the University’s Minority Health Conference titled “Bridging the Gap” in Fall 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new study involving researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago achieved a milestone in the synthesis of multifunctional photonic nanomaterials.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03563">paper published in the American Chemical Society&#8217;s journal Nano Letters</a>, they report the synthesis of semiconductor “giant” core-shell quantum dots with record-breaking emissive lifetimes. In addition, the lifetimes can be tuned by making a simple alteration to the material’s internal structure.&nbsp;</p>

The lifetimes can be 10-times greater compared with similar materials.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The group, which included collaborators from Princeton University and Pennsylvania State University, demonstrated a new structure-property concept that imparts the ability to spatially localize electrons or holes within a core/shell heterostructure by tuning the charge carrier’s kinetic energy on a parabolic potential energy surface.</p>



<p>According to UIC chemist Preston Snee, this charge carrier separation results in extended radiative lifetimes and in continuous emission at the single-nanoparticle level.</p>



<p>“These properties enable new applications for optics, facilitate novel approaches such as time-gated single-particle imaging and create inroads for the development of other new advanced materials,” said Snee, UIC associate professor of chemistry and the study’s senior co-author.</p>



<p>Snee and the study’s first author, Marcell Pálmai, UIC postdoctoral research associate in chemistry, teamed with Haw Yang of Princeton and others to excite the quantum dots particle with light to put it in the “exciton” state. The exciton is an electron/hole charge pair, and in the new materials, the electron becomes displaced from the center to the shell, where it becomes trapped for upwards of 500 nanoseconds, which represents the record for such nanomaterials.</p>



<p>“As emissive materials, quantum dots hold the promise of creating more energy-efficient displays and can be used as fluorescent probes for biomedical research due to their highly robust optical properties. They are 10 times to 100 times more absorptive than organic dyes and are nearly impervious to photobleaching, which is why they are used in the new Samsung QLED-TV,” they write.&nbsp;</p>

(B) Typical single-particle emission trajectory of type II CdZnSe/CdS gQDs shows no blinking behavior.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>These new particles have great efficacy for fundamental biological discovery, according to the researchers.</p>



<p>The quantum dots presented in their paper emit at red wavelengths, which minimizes scattering, while the long lifetimes allow for biological imaging to be performed with less background noise. At the single particle level, the new quantum dots emit continuously, so a research scientist can tag proteins relevant to cancer and follow the biological dynamics without losing track of the signal which is currently a common problem with such studies.</p>



<p>In future research, the group plans to demonstrate that the materials make good components for optical devices such as micron-sized lasers.</p>



<p>Additional co-authors of the paper are Marcell Pálmai, Eun Byoel Kim, Prakash Parajuli, Kyle Tomczak, Kai Wang, Bibash Sapkota, Nan Jiang and Robert F. Klie of UIC; Joseph S. Beckwith, Nyssa T. Emerson, Shuhui Yin and Tian Zhao of Princeton; and Ming Tien of Pennsylvania State University.</p>



<p>Funding from the University of Illinois Chicago primarily supported this work. The research was also supported by funding from the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund and grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DE-SC0019364), the Fonds National Suisse de la Recherche Scientifique (P2GEP2_191208) and the National Science Foundation (CHE-1944796).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The University of Illinois Chicago’s Division of Specialized Care for Children sponsors the conference and serves on its steering committee]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ayla Etheridge, who was born with a spinal lipoma and uses a wheelchair, is a careful planner who is extremely tech-savvy and loves gaming, character design and writing.</p>
<p>As she attended the Illinois Statewide Transition Conference recently, Etheridge, 16, thought more about how these interests and skills will shape her future and career goals.</p>
<p>“I’m very independent and would like to do more things myself,” Etheridge said. “This conference has kind of helped me visualize and think about my next steps.”</p>
<p>The 17th annual transition conference, titled “Stepping Stones of Transition,” took place in East Peoria Nov. 3-4. The conference helps families and professionals learn about the resources, information and opportunities available for youth with disabilities as they prepare for adulthood.</p>
<p>Etheridge and her mom, Rachel, were among nearly 450 people who attended in person.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago’s Division of Specialized Care for Children sponsors the conference and serves on its steering committee.</p>
<p>DSCC also covered the related costs for 34 participant family members to attend, including the Etheridges and the Barraza family.</p>
<p>“I am so thankful to DSCC for the fact they covered the cost to be here. That made a big difference in us being able to attend,” Anita Barraza said.</p>
<h3>“Education empowers me”</h3>
<p>Anita’s son, Daniel Barraza, 17, is a DSCC participant. His older sister, Diana Barraza, 22, left DSCC last summer.</p>
<p>Anita Barraza is an occupational therapist who works with schoolchildren, so she understands both sides of the need for information and resources when supporting young adults with disabilities.</p>
<p>“As a parent, we can feel so overwhelmed. Even if help is right there, that reach can be hard to do,” Anita Barraza said.</p>
<p>That’s why opportunities to learn about a variety of resources and network with other families and professionals are so important.</p>
<p>“These types of resources educate me on how to best provide for my children’s needs and for their future,” Anita Barraza said.</p>
<p>“Education empowers me to be better prepared to help (Diana and Daniel) have a good quality of life.&#8221;</p>
<h3>“One step ahead”</h3>
<p>Anita Barraza had told two other DSCC moms about the conference and encouraged them to attend. One is her friend, Yessy Castillo.</p>
<p>Though Castillo&#8217;s son, Jacob Ortiz, is only 4 years old, she knew it was important to go.</p>
<p>“I want to be aware of what services are available for Jacob,” Castillo said. “Most importantly, I want to be one step ahead. This conference allows me to get the information on what can benefit Jacob.”</p>
<p>Jacob was born with a cleft palate, an underdeveloped jaw and other body malformations, and depends on a ventilator 24-7 to breathe.</p>
<p>“I appreciate getting the opportunity to meet people and attorneys for advice and support and more legal information on Jacob’s rights,” she said. “If I was not exposed to these events, I wouldn’t know what is available.”</p>
<p>Conference attendee Melania Tinoco said connecting with other families helped her feel more confident.</p>
<p>“It helps seeing we’re all in the same boat and finding out we aren’t alone,” Tinoco said.</p>
<p>Her daughter, Jeny, is 14 and has been a DSCC participant since birth. Jeny has Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome, a rare genetic and neurological condition that causes developmental delays.</p>
<p>Tinoco said the conference has helped her plan for the future, and she appreciated the breakout sessions on helping youth with disabilities respect their body and feel empowered to say “no.”</p>
<p>“The information has been helpful and inspirational,” Tinoco said.</p>
<h3>Putting information into action</h3>
<p>The conference consisted of informative breakout sessions in the areas of employment, education, health care and more.</p>
<p>DSCC participant Vera Lynn Lindquist, 17, and her grandmother, Cheryl Lindquist Calcese, said they enjoyed the “Awareness and Transition Services for Students with Disabilities” session. It gave them helpful information on sex education and tips for building good money management skills.</p>
<p>They plan to start a budget system at home after the conference. Lindquist, who has autism and other disorders, will get paid for doing chores and get a debit card to purchase items and track spending.</p>
<p>DSCC participant Sabrina Doueihi, 20, was among several self-advocates who shared their perspectives during the “Transition Success Stories” breakout session. She is a junior at Bradley College, where she is studying criminology. She hopes to go to law school and become a prosecutor.</p>
<p>She spoke about the importance of staying true to yourself and what you want to do. She also recommended that youth with disabilities focus on what they can do and who can help them achieve their goals.</p>
<h3>“Trade stories and network”</h3>
<p>For brothers Jaysen and Justen McMenamin, and their parents, the transition conference was a good opportunity to plan for life after high school.</p>
<p>Jaysen McMenamin, 18, is a senior at Woodland High School near Streator, where he is an honor roll student and honorary captain of the school’s football team. He&#8217;s interested in digital media and related job opportunities. Justen McMenamin, 14, is a freshman at Woodland High and interested in coding. Both brothers have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and are enrolled with DSCC.</p>
<p>Their stepfather, Charles Cusick, said the family wanted to learn more about jobs and career fields that are accessible.</p>
<p>The brothers’ mom, Deanna Cox, said she appreciated the breakout session on Supplemental Security Income benefits. Jaysen and Justen’s dad passed away in June, and the session helped her better understand how to help her boys keep the benefits they’re entitled to.</p>
<p>The family met up with their DSCC Care Coordinator Kristin Lenover during the conference.</p>
<p>“If families can get away from work, there’s so much they will get out of being at the transition conference,” Lenover said. “Attending in person gives you so much access to all kinds of information. There are also opportunities to meet other families, trade stories and network.”</p>
<p>Thirty DSCC team members attended the conference to network, learn from others and strengthen their skillsets and tools to serve participant families.</p>
<p>DSCC also sponsored the conference’s health care track for providers who play a role in the transition from the pediatric to adult health care system and those who build youth’s capacity and health care skills to prepare for adulthood.</p>
<p>DSCC Transition Specialist Darcy Contri has helped plan the conference since it began 17 years ago. This year’s event was her last before she retires.</p>
<p>“I’m so grateful for and have loved being part of this great work,” Contri said. “Partnering with talented people from organizations across the state to help others has made a positive difference in so many lives. It is my hope the annual conference will continue to make an impact on improving adult outcomes for youth with disabilities for many more years.”</p>

<p>UIC sociologist Amy Bailey describes Christine “CC” Hier as “intellectually fearless, deeply committed to using her scholarship for social justice and exceptionally focused on her academic pursuits.”</p>
<p>Through her Honors College capstone project at UIC, Hier has deepened her dedication to social justice and pursuit of a career involving research that informs public policy on racial inequality. </p>
<p>In a class led by Bailey, associate professor of sociology and Hier’s Honors College Fellow, Hier coded archival documents related to lynchings that occurred in the southern United States. It served as the inspiration for her capstone project, which examines multigenerational trauma that connects the history of lynching in the U.S. with ongoing murders by police.</p>
<p>Diligently working on such an intense and personal subject for the past 18 months has been fulfilling and moving — but most importantly necessary, according to Hier.</p>
<p>“It’s very prudent for where we are as a society today. In my research, I don&#8217;t just look at historical lynchings that we are ‘familiar’ with in terms of their historical context, but I bring that into the modern day and define modern-day lynchings under police murders and focus on the lack of due process,” she said. “I love that this project solidifies what I love to do, and I know that this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>After she graduates with a bachelor’s degree in sociology Dec. 10 from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Hier wants to continue inequality research and is currently exploring international graduate school opportunities at Sciences Po in Paris, Oxford and Cambridge. She hopes to eventually hold a management role with a nonprofit, such as Black Lives Matter, that allows her to work on research to help inform public policies.</p>
<p>“Lynching was just signed into law as a federal hate crime this year so I think that says a lot about how far we still have to go with protecting Black and brown lives. This is absolutely what I want to do and what I&#8217;m extremely passionate about,” she said.</p>
<p>Hier looks back at her time at UIC as a “wonderful experience,” particularly developing important connections and interpersonal relationships with students and professors alike.</p>
<p>“I love being super-involved with professors in my classes, and with other students in collaborative work,” she said. “My last couple years have just been wonderful being able to be on campus, interact and knock on doors and just say, ‘Hey, do you have a minute?’”</p>
<p>”Her genuine excitement about learning and ideas, even communicated over Zoom during the depths of the pandemic, was infectious,” Bailey said.</p>
<p>She is a member of the French and Sociology clubs at UIC and was the only sociologist in the first cohort of UIC’s <a href="https://surf.econ.uic.edu/">Social insurance Undergraduate Research Fellowship</a>, a competitive program that provides promising undergraduate students with an introduction to the policies surrounding the social safety net and opportunities for research investigating these programs, and their impact on economically vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>During and after high school, the native of Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood dealt with family and mental health matters that delayed her college career. She worked for 10 years in high-end retail businesses and restaurants.</p>
<p>“I just realized that my questioning spirit wasn&#8217;t a good fit for most jobs,” she said. “My struggle with depression and anxiety is ongoing, but since finding purpose and reason within academia, I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.”</p>
<p>Hier eventually applied that inquisitive nature during two years of study at Harold Washington College, which served as her springboard to UIC. There she was drawn to research and a potential career in sociology through the mentorship of professor and UIC alumnus Juan Martinez.</p>
<p>“Taking the first sociology classes just really ignited what I now know as sociological imagination, and it solidified those parts of my personality that I knew were always going to end up in sociology one way or another,” she said. “As a Black woman, I wanted to be able to influence Black research within sociology. We&#8217;re few and far between in the field, and being able to research racial inequality in Black spaces was really important to me.”</p>
<p>For Hier, who wondered if she would ever experience this moment, reflecting on the path to commencement is an emotional and proud moment.</p>
<p>“It was very freeing being able to pursue something that I&#8217;ve always been very passionate about, and in a capacity that I&#8217;m able to perform at my highest level,” she said. “I would hope that if anybody is struggling with their mental health or not being seen or heard, that they can kind of look at this and say, ‘OK, if I just go one more day, maybe it&#8217;ll get better.’”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A citizen of the Lac Du Flambeau Nation of Wisconsin, Erica Bhatti aims to provide her fellow citizens with medical care]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>As a citizen of the Lac du Flambeau Tribe of Wisconsin, Erica Bhatti’s dream has been to return to her reservation as a doctor and give back by providing her fellow citizens with proper medical care.</p>

Photo provided.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The University of Illinois Chicago student will be one step closer to achieving this goal when she graduates from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Dec. 10 with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in neuroscience. Bhatti plans to continue her studies in medical school.</p>



<p>She described the reservation, which is more than 350 miles north of Chicago in northern Wisconsin, as a quaint community of about 2,000 people, where her mother’s side of the family lives as citizens. As a child, she lived with her parents in Paris, France, before relocating with her mother and siblings to the reservation.</p>



<p>“I grew up outside in the Northwoods, learning how to fish and gather medicines; it’s a very beautiful and traditional way of life up there,” Bhatti said.</p>



<p>After attending a local community college near her home in Wisconsin her freshman year, she realized that she needed more research opportunities and looked at Chicago and UIC as places that could offer her more to achieve her dreams. What drew her to UIC was its focus on research, which would go along with her focus as a pre-medicine student.</p>



<p>During a visit to campus before her sophomore year, she was pleasantly surprised to discover that UIC had an active <a href="https://nasp.uic.edu/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nasp.uic.edu/">Native American Support Program</a>. She then learned that since 2019 the university has been <a href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-to-offer-in-state-tuition-to-students-from-any-of-the-573-tribal-nations-in-us/">offering in-state tuition</a> to students who are members of any of the 573 tribal nations recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p>



<p>“I chose to go to UIC because it leads in research, and I knew I wanted to be in pre-medicine so that was the big reason why I came and toured the campus,” Bhatti said. “Then I saw that there was a recognized Native American Support Program, and in-state tuition and that was the cherry on top. That program has saved me thousands of dollars.”</p>



<p>For her research she became involved in the <a href="https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/departments/academic-departments/pediatrics/research/path-2-purpose/">Path 2 Purpose</a> study, which is a free, voluntary program for teenagers who want to improve their mood and learn coping skills to manage difficult situations. Pioneered by leading universities including UIC, the study is a clinical trial that will determine how best to help teens build healthy lifestyles.</p>



<p>“I just really enjoyed the interaction I had with teens. I was able to have research experience under my belt. so that has been really helpful,” she said.</p>



<p>Bhatti, who is president of the Native American and Indigenous Students Organization, credited the Native American Support Program for extending its reach off campus to the American Indian Center of Chicago, with whom it holds close ties. She said this allowed her to be exposed to more of what Chicago had to offer in regard to Indigenous issues. The Native American Support Program also connected her with the American Indian Health Service of Chicago, which she expects will be a resource as an Indigenous physician in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;As president of NAISO, I planned events, collaborated with other student organizations, connected with my peers, and assisted&nbsp;in planning the annual&nbsp;UIC Powwow,&#8221; Bhatti said. &#8220;Obtaining this title was very exciting and important for me as I have learned some important&nbsp;life skills like leadership and outreach. I was very proud to represent Indigenous students at UIC.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She said she plans to take a gap year to study for the medical school entrance exam and gain more experience with patients by working in a hospital or getting certified to work on an ambulance. She would like to get a dual degree that would allow her to earn her medical degree as well as a master’s in public health.</p>



<p>“UIC has guided me tremendously in terms of what I want for my future,” Bhatti said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Latrice Yates found the support she needed to thrive on campus from UIC’s Student Success Units]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/image-9/"><img loading="lazy" width="386" height="258" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image-386x258.jpg" alt="Latrice Yates" class="wp-image-139204" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image-386x258.jpg 386w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image-590x394.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image-500x334.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /></a><figcaption>Latrice Yates</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>During her first few weeks at UIC, Latrice Yates found the support she needed to thrive on campus from UIC’s <a href="https://vpuaap.uic.edu/offices-and-programs/success-units/">Student Success Units</a>, so she made it her mission to pay it forward by dedicating her time to helping others leave their mark on campus and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>“I loved every single moment at UIC, and I’m very grateful for all the opportunities that came my way,” said Yates, who graduates Dec. 10 from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences with a bachelor’s degree in applied psychology.</p>
<p>Yates grew up in Rockford, then moved to Carrollton, Texas, with her family in high school, but she set her sights on returning to Illinois for college.</p>
<p>“I missed Chicago a lot, and I wanted to do whatever it took to come back,” said Yates, who also is a member of the Honors College.</p>
<p>When she arrived on campus in the fall of 2019, Yates attended the <a href="https://aaan.uic.edu/">African American Academic Network</a>’s annual Black 2 School BBQ and met new friends and staff members, including Jeff Brown, AAAN director.</p>
<p>“AAAN was a resource for me from day one,” Yates said. “When I told Jeff Brown I was looking for a job, he actually went and introduced me to the different offices in SSB, and he helped me find my first job.”</p>
<p>“From his grace, I was able to find a lot of different opportunities, and I was able to feel more comfortable asking for help. Everybody in AAAN is willing to help. Their commitment to getting involved with the success of students early is a huge reason I was able to find the skills and opportunities to get involved.”</p>
<p>During her first semester, Yates also was looking for a writing tutor, so she reached out to the <a href="https://ace.uic.edu/">Academic Center for Excellence</a> for help.</p>
<p>“ACE helped me by being a resource for all of the questions I had,” Yates said. “There were so many resources and organizations on campus, and I just didn’t know where to begin. They made it less complicated.”</p>
<p>Because these support units had set Yates up for success, she wanted to get involved with them and give back. She dedicated her time to becoming a peer success coach for ACE and a peer tutor for AAAN.</p>
<p>For AAAN, she assists students with their English and Spanish coursework.</p>
<p>“When we first start our tutoring sessions, I always ask how they&#8217;re doing, and we have a conversation about the things that they&#8217;re going through,” Yates said. “So even though the primary function is for academics, it&#8217;s also a support network to make sure that they’re doing OK mentally and emotionally as well.”</p>
<p>As a peer success coach with ACE, Yates mentors first-year and transfer students, providing outreach and education about campus resources, deadlines to remember, ways to get involved and more. She also hosts office hours so students can drop in to talk about their career goals, academic timelines or just find support from a familiar face.</p>
<p>“I love being a resource one can rely on because I think everyone should know all UIC has to offer,” she said.</p>
<p>The psychology department and AAAN also helped connect Yates with the <a href="https://grad.uic.edu/diversity/srop-program/">Summer Research Opportunities Program</a>, where she assisted UIC faculty members Geri Donenberg and Natasha Crooks in creating a program to encourage Black fathers to talk with their daughters, ages 13 to 18, about sexually transmitted infections.</p>
<p>“In the Black community, the father doesn&#8217;t think that it’s their role to have those conversations,” Yates said. “But really, we believe that they&#8217;re actually essential to having those conversations. We try to teach communication methods and make sure that they have those healthy relationships so that the daughter could, in turn, go to them for questions that they have about sexual health because they&#8217;re the best person to get it from, compared to going to their friends, who might not have the most accurate information.”</p>
<p>Her work with AAAN and the summer research program helped Yates determine the focus for her future research.</p>
<p>“UIC has prepared me for a future in psychology, and I&#8217;m very grateful for all the opportunities that allowed me to explore and see what was for me,” she said. “Working with an all-Black staff and an all-Black population has been my confirmation that I want to continue to cater to this population, but with emphasis on the mental health disparities.”</p>
<p>Yates is now applying to doctoral programs with the goal of becoming a clinical psychologist.</p>
<p>“I want to focus on Black girls specifically and implement mental health programs for this demographic because I feel like in that community, mental health doesn’t really get addressed,” Yates said. “I think it gets overlooked and I want to offer that support.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We are writing to provide an update on the status [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are writing to provide an update on the status of collective bargaining with UIC United Faculty, the union representing tenure/tenure-track and non-tenure track faculty with 51% time or more, including visiting faculty, at UIC.</p>



<p>Today was the 21st negotiating session, the fifth with the guidance of an independent federal mediator. To date, the parties have reached agreement on 15 of 23 contract items under deliberation and continue to make progress and exchange proposals that move us closer to resolution.</p>



<p>We are confident that much can be accomplished through continued bargaining. Negotiation sessions are already planned for Dec. 6 and 12. The university offered to meet again later this week and anticipate additional sessions will be scheduled to move this contract forward.</p>



<p>UIC United Faculty filed the legally required 10-day Notice of Intent to Strike with the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board on Nov. 17. This does not mean that a strike will necessarily occur, and the union has not announced a strike date. All parties care deeply about our students and keep their best interests at heart.&nbsp;The university’s intent is to resolve these negotiations without any disruption to teaching and learning—especially as we head into finals next week.</p>



<p>The university will continue to provide updates to our campus community regarding significant developments in negotiations via email and on our website at&nbsp;<a href="http://facultybargaining.uic.edu/">facultybargaining.uic.edu</a>.</p>

<p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that women over the age of 65 may be undergoing unnecessary cervical cancer screenings and that more public health data is needed on the utilization of cervical cancer screening-associated services among older women to prevent potential harm and unnecessary costs.</p>



<p>The study, which is authored by experts from the University of Illinois Chicago, the University of California San Francisco and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at Medicare claims data from 1999 to 2019 for fee-for-service care for women over the age of 65.</p>



<p>The analysis showed that in 2019 more than 1.3 million women received cervical cancer screening-associated services, such as a Pap test, colposcopy and other cervical procedures, after age 65. While these services cost more than $83 million, the researchers concluded they were of “unclear clinical appropriateness.”</p>



<p>“Cervical cancer screening and other preventive services are among our most important tools for keeping people healthy throughout life, but screenings should also follow evidence-based guidelines to prevent overspending, potential complications and patient discomfort,” said study co-author Dr. Hunter Holt, assistant professor of family and community medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago.</p>



<p>“Cancer screening involves a judicious consideration of the balance between both benefits and harms. As people get older, the potential benefits decline and the potential harms increase,” said co-author Dr. George Sawaya, professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California San Francisco.</p>



<p>According to recommendations and guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, women considered to be of average risk can stop undergoing routine cervical cancer screening once they reach the age of 65 if they have had adequate prior screening.</p>



<p>“The decision to end cervical cancer screening for women after age 65 requires review of past screening results and related medical history. This process can promote cervical cancer prevention and prevent harms and costs from unnecessary tests and procedures,” said Jin Qin, study co-author and epidemiologist in CDC’s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control.</p>



<p>The researchers say that the high rates of screening among older women is potentially concerning.</p>



<p>“It could be that women are getting screened when they do not need to, or that these women are considered to be at higher-than-average risk, for example, because they have not been adequately screened prior to 65. We do not want to see either of these things and unfortunately, there is not enough public health data to shed light on the causes,” said Holt, who is also affiliated with the University of Illinois Cancer Center at UIC.</p>



<p>“In this study, about 3% of women aged over 80 years received at least one screening-related service. The Society for General Internal Medicine does not recommend cancer screening be performed in individuals with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, which corresponds to age 80 and older in the U.S., so there may well be over-screening,” Sawaya said.</p>



<p>The study showed that white women were more likely to be screened after age 65, and that Black and Latina women were more likely to undergo a diagnostic colposcopy and subsequent cervical procedures.</p>



<p>Overall, the analysis found that the percentage of women over age 65 who received at least one Pap test decreased from 19% (2.9 million women) in 1999 to 9% (1.3 million women) in 2019, a reduction of 55%. Rates of colposcopy and cervical procedures decreased 43% and 64%, respectively.</p>



<p>“While cervical cancer is a more top-of-mind concern for younger women than older women, women over the age of 65 represent about 20% of diagnoses and 36% of deaths due to cervical cancer. It is critical that we develop better data to understand how screenings are being used among this population and if screening services are being used appropriately,” Holt said.</p>



<p>Co-authors of “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2798311">Utilization Trends and Recent Expenditures for Cervical Cancer Screening-Associated Services in Medicare Fee-for-Service Beneficiaries over Age 65</a>” also include Dr. Thomas Richards and Dr. Mona Saraiya of the CDC.</p>

<p>Two University of Illinois Chicago engineering students were recently named ComEd Scholars and will be provided scholarships to fill the tuition gap not covered by financial aid.</p>



<p>The students, Chanel Hamilton and Aaron Tillery, make up the 2022 ComEd Scholars fourth cohort and are part of the UIC CHANCE program’s <a href="https://chance.uic.edu/community-outreach/pre-college-programs/summer-camp-stem-academy/">STEM Academy</a>.</p>



<p>Tillery is a second-year student from Chicago’s Washington Heights neighborhood who is pursuing a degree in computer engineering, and Hamilton is a first-year student from suburban Country Club Hills who is pursuing an engineering degree.</p>



<p>Tillery said he was extremely grateful and honored to be one of ComEd’s new scholarship recipients. He said he was thankful for &#8220;all of the amazing leaders and staff&#8221; at UIC, CHANCE and ComEd.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since entering college, I have been able to work harder and get one step closer to my dream of becoming a computer engineer. Being able to build technology for the future and help my city is something that I strive to achieve,&#8221; Tillery said. &#8220;With the help of ComEd and the CHANCE program, I am on the path to doing so. I am blessed and excited about what the future holds.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a new college student and as a first-generation student, Hamilton said she appreciated the help and financial support that CHANCE and ComEd have offered her. The support began for her when she was involved in the program’s summer engineering class.</p>

Photo by Carl Ankrum.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>“Not only did I learn how to do some of the more difficult aspects of engineering as an aspiring engineer, but I also learned about the open and inclusive environment at UIC,” Hamilton said. “I was extremely excited to apply to UIC when I heard about this incredible opportunity with ComEd because I admire the work that ComEd has done for the community. I will make CHANCE and ComEd proud.” </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.comed.com/SafetyCommunity/Education/Pages/ForCollegeStudents.aspx">ComEd Scholars program</a> aims to invest in a diverse workforce, ComEd officials said. In addition to the UIC students, two students from the Illinois Institute of Technology, also known as Illinois Tech, also were recipients.</p>



<p>The ComEd Scholars program, in its fourth year, provides scholarships to students pursuing degrees in STEM that cover education-related costs that exceed financial aid. Since the ComEd Scholars Program&#8217;s inception in 2019, 26 students have been awarded support.</p>



<p>“ComEd’s commitment to creating the diverse STEM workforce of the future exemplifies what it means to create equitable pathways for the next generation of leaders and change-makers,” said UIC Interim Chancellor Javier Reyes. “We are thankful for this partnership and investment in UIC students.”</p>



<p>ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones said the scholarships represent “an investment in your academic and professional journey.” He said the company aims to provide students with exposure through its internships and assistance to become STEM leaders.</p>



<p>In addition to financial assistance, the ComEd Scholars are also granted the opportunity to interview for internships at ComEd and its parent company, Exelon, and are encouraged to participate in a mentorship program with ComEd engineers.</p>



<p>“At ComEd we are committed to diversifying the STEM workforce and supporting talented students from across our communities,” Quiniones said. “The ComEd Scholars program seeks to give students knowledge, confidence and resources to not only achieve their education and career aspirations, but to also have a meaningful impact in their communities for years to come.”</p>



<p>UIC’s <a href="https://chance.uic.edu/">CHANCE program</a> began in 2004 and was designed to assist the university with its goal to increase recruitment, retention and graduation rates of underrepresented students in partnership with Chicago Public Schools, City Colleges of Chicago, community-based organizations, various suburban school districts and charter schools. CHANCE stands for Counseling Help and Assistance Necessary for a 21st Century College Education.</p>



<p>&#8220;This partnership continues to enhance the lives of our scholars. The CHANCE Program is delighted to work with ComEd,” CHANCE Director Khalilah Young said. “This opportunity is life-altering; we are so grateful to ComEd for investing in the brilliant minds here at UIC.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[New research from the Jane Addams College of Social Work]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Researchers at the Jane Addams College of Social Work, led by associate professor Otima Doyle, have published a study in the Journal of Child and Family Studies on how African American fathers envision prevention programs aimed at supporting African American male youths who are at-risk for developing depression and/or aggressive behaviors. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The journal’s editors recently selected the paper, titled “</span><a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10826/updates/19243374"><span data-contrast="none">All About How You Couch It:” African American Fathers’ Visions of Interventions for their Sons</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">” as an ‘Editors’ Choice’ article based on its scientific quality and public health relevance. The paper is available free to the public until Nov. 30.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Studies focusing on the behavioral health needs of young African American boys, as well as the strengths, contributions, and challenges faced by fathers (especially men living away from the child and are low-income) have been increasing. There remains, however, much to be learned, Doyle said. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Her latest work, which was assisted by colleagues Branden McLeod, PhD, associate professor at the Jane Addams College of Social Work, and Qiana R. Cryer-Coupet, PhD, associate professor of social work at Georgia State University who received her doctorate degree from the JACSW in 2015, is one of several related papers completed from this dataset. The related papers emphasize African American fathers’ co-parenting experiences, parenting practices, values they have passed down to their sons, and recruitment of fathers into clinically relevant programs. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Doyle’s research centers on how a father-focused approach to programming can prevent the onset of depression and aggression among African American youth who are at-risk. African American fathers are often involved in their children’s lives, even when they do not live with their children, and when they are no longer romantically involved with their children’s mother(s). Numerous fatherhood interventions have been developed, such as those included in the Responsible Fatherhood Programs, yet Doyle and her colleagues believe that “it is important to look deeper into the lived experiences of African American fathers,” she said. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many African American youth are exposed to risk factors that can lead to the development of aggressive behaviors and depressive symptoms, such as lack of neighborhood safety, poverty, and racism. Moreover, “African Americans’ experiences with mood disorders, such as depression, may be particularly chronic and burdensome, and they are less likely than their White peers to receive care,” Doyle said. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Those who receive treatment may be misdiagnosed due to nuanced clinical presentations of depression, which, on the surface, might look like anger, aggression or irritability,” she said. “Such misdiagnoses increase the risk of suicide, which rose by 60% between 2001 and 2017 among African American adolescent males.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A notable contribution of the study is the first-hand accounts of the African American fathers who reported being active in their sons’ lives. Doyle conducted extensive interviews with 30 African American fathers whose biological sons, ranging in age from eight to 12, were at individual-, family-, or community-level risk for developing aggressive behaviors and/or depressive symptoms. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Numerous themes emerged from Doyle’s research. In those refrains fathers candidly expressed ideas about what could be useful in terms of the program content, as well as how such a program might be structured to best meet the needs of – and be of interest to – African American fathers and their sons. Fathers emphasized the importance of a strength-based approach that honors their lived realities. They endorsed group-based interventions characterized by a safe space, bonding opportunities with fathers and sons, and hands-on activities. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Fathers were interested in learning from their peers about parenting, but felt opportunities were limited to do so in a safe space where they could talk candidly about their experiences, including fears, worries, challenges and triumphs.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Bonding across families can also be beneficial.</span><span data-contrast="none"> Stated one father, “If you know that your son’s having an issue with this, have him talk to somebody else that can give him a different insight, different view. ‘Cause a lot of times we will receive things from somebody else before we receive it from our own parents directly.” </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The study’s findings, Doyle said, have direct implications for father-focused interventions. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“They highlight the importance of creating safe spaces for African American fathers to interact with each other and their sons, as well as the need to incorporate – or center – kinesthetic activities,&#8221; Doyle said.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear colleagues, What I find common among many of us [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="p1">Dear colleagues,</p>
<p class="p1">What I find common among many of us who work for UIC is our dedication to its unique mission. Each of us is inspired by a different piece of it.</p>
<p class="p1">GivingTuesday, happening tomorrow, is a day built for all of us to show our support for the piece of UIC’s mission that most inspires and fulfills us. Your contributions on <a href="https://givingtuesday.uic.edu/"><span class="s1">givingtuesday.uic.edu</span></a>, no matter the size, goes immediately to helping a person or initiative to do bigger, bolder work in an area that matters to you.</p>
<p class="p1">The goal on GivingTuesday, as always, is participation. Know that collectively, your donations at all levels make an incredible impact on the good work happening across UIC. Last year, the vast majority of GivingTuesday gifts were under $250. Yet total contributions topped $1 million. And of 1,828 donors who participated, more than 31% were faculty and staff. Of course, <a href="https://go.uic.edu/champion"><span class="s2">there are many ways to participate</span></a> beyond giving.</p>
<p class="p1">If we can meet our GivingTuesday goal of topping 2,000 donors, it will build on a time of incredible momentum at UIC. We could add this feat to record-breaking enrollment and research numbers, a rise in the rankings that matter and the success of our history-making IGNITE Campaign. Here’s a tip: Keep an eye on the leaderboard to see how we’re doing.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m proud to work alongside you each day to support students and faculty, pursue new knowledge, uplift communities and fight for justice and equity. If past GivingTuesdays are any indication, I’m confident tomorrow’s results will be nothing less than remarkable.</p>
<p class="p1">Thank you and go Flames!</p>
<p class="p1">Tom Wamsley<br />Vice Chancellor for Advancement</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Support student success, faculty innovation and more with a gift on GivingTuesday Nov. 29]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>UIC students and faculty change the world by discovering cures, connecting communities, demanding justice and more. Make a gift on GivingTuesday Nov. 29 to empower their work.</p>
<p>“One of the things that is most common among UIC faculty and staff is our collective dedication to UIC’s mission. GivingTuesday is a moment in the year for each of us to pause and demonstrate our commitment to it in a way that works for us,” said Tom Wamsley, vice chancellor for advancement. “Together, our contributions as a community drive the transformational work that happens at UIC every day.”</p>
<p>Since 2013, UIC has engaged in GivingTuesday, a global movement that inspires people to give, collaborate and celebrate generosity.</p>
<p>Participate in GivingTuesday by <a href="https://givingtuesday.uic.edu/">donating online</a> now through Dec. 2. Donors can select which college or unit they would like to support, as well as choose funds that immediately impact student scholarships, faculty initiatives, community engagement, social justice initiatives and more.</p>
<p>During a record-shattering GivingTuesday initiative in 2021, donors to UIC contributed $1,032,838 toward supporting students, faculty initiatives, community engagement and research. The 2021 GivingTuesday initiative saw a 15% increase in the number of donors, with 1,828 alumni, friends, faculty, staff, students and parents contributing gifts in support of UIC.   </p>
<p>This year’s goal is to reach 2,000 donors.</p>
<p>“Every UIC employee, every day, is contributing to UIC. GivingTuesday, however, is a true demonstration of the power of collective giving,” Wamsley said. “Last year the vast majority of GivingTuesday gifts were under $250. Yet total contributions topped $1 million. Every single contribution, no matter the size, immediately goes to fueling work that answers UIC’s mission.”</p>
<p>Students are also encouraged to post a message on social media about how they want to change the world using the hashtags #UICtogether and #GivingTuesday. Students and other supporters can access images and <a href="https://go.uic.edu/champion">sample posts online</a>.</p>
<p>“Students and their families can give as well if they’re able. But their advocacy and championing UIC is just as important,” Wamsley said. “They can support the cause by posting on social media why they are proud to be part of UIC.”</p>
<p> </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UIC Associate Professor Rachel Poretsky, from the UIC Department of Biological Sciences in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, accepted a Chicago Innovation Award Nov. 16 on behalf of a collaborative, multi-institution team effort to monitor the ebb and flow of COVID-19 in Chicago and Illinois by detecting the virus&#8217;s presence in wastewater.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team was assembled by Discovery Partners Institute — the organization that received the award —  and was one of the first teams in the nation to reliably analyze samples of raw sewage for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 2021, providing real-time information to help both the Chicago Department of Public Health and the Illinois Department of Public Health during the pandemic.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Illinois Wastewater Surveillance System is a collaboration between the IDPH and the DPI-led team which, in addition to UIC, includes Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory. Under a separate contract, DPI and those same partners provide similar services for CDPH.</span></p>



<p>Poretsky&#8217;s team at UIC includes Jarju Modou, visiting lab technician; Chi-Yu Lin, visiting research scholar;  Dolores Sanchez, visiting lab manager; Adam Horton, lab manager; and UIC graduate students Leah Kelly and Christopher Owen. </p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are proud to be recognized by the Chicago Innovation judges after less than three years of DPI really getting off the ground,” DPI Executive Director Bill Jackson said. “Our success in wastewater surveillance shows the promise of our mission, which is to bring together the best minds in greater Chicago and beyond to solve some of the toughest problems facing society.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This honor belongs to our entire team,” said Laura Clements, DPI’s senior project manager for R&amp;D. “Each one is crucial to the success of this undertaking — we literally couldn’t have accomplished this without them.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is excreted in the feces and urine of infected people even if they have no symptoms. Suspended in raw sewage, these telltales eventually make their way into wastewater treatment facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 75 wastewater treatment plants in metro Chicago and elsewhere in Illinois voluntarily submit sewage samples to the DPI team twice weekly. These are analyzed at a high-throughput lab built by UIC and then sent to Argonne for genetic sequencing to identify variants.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Chicago, samples are also drawn directly from specific neighborhood sewers to get a more localized picture of COVID-19 trends, and at O’Hare International Airport to spot new variants that travelers might be bringing into the area.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results are shared with public health decision-makers, wastewater plant operators and the public through a variety of mechanisms, including online dashboards.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, the network has expanded to more than 80 monitoring sites measuring the exposure of more than 8 million people in Illinois to COVID-19, or more than two-thirds of the state’s population. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DPI and Shield T3, a for-profit startup spun out of University of Illinois, are also conducting a </span><a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/resource-center/news/2022/september/idph-and-university-of-illinois-spinoff-launch-wastewater-testin.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pilot program to test wastewater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the coronavirus at public schools.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawing from these experiences, DPI additionally is partnering with UIC and Rush University Medical Center to collect and analyze wastewater to identify the presence of </span><a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/rush-discovery-partners-institute-awarded-cdc-contract-to-test-wastewater-for-antibiotic-resistant-organisms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially deadly antibiotic-resistant organisms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in long-term care facilities. And the DPI team recently began screening sewage samples for influenza A and B for the state.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Innovation’s mission is to empower the Chicago Innovation Ecosystem by educating, connecting and celebrating innovators. The Chicago Innovation Awards began in 2002. The more than 350 previous winners cut across all industries, representing big companies, small companies, for-profit and not-for-profit, high-tech, low-tech and no-tech. They demonstrate the breadth of innovation that is unique to the Chicago region.</span></p>

<p>Elizabeth McMath has joined the <a href="https://chicagobiomedicalconsortium.org/">Chicago Biomedical Consortium</a>, a research and education collaboration of the University of Illinois Chicago, Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, as the senior director of new program innovation and entrepreneurship. </p>



<p>McMath brings extensive experience in the evaluation of new therapies and biomedical innovation, most recently as director of global search and evaluation at Novartis. There, she built the deal pipeline for clinical stage programs addressing severe genetic diseases including innovative gene therapies as part of the former AveXis, now Novartis Gene Therapies business unit.</p>



<p>Bringing industry perspectives and rigorous evaluation methodologies, McMath will be responsible for driving the CBC’s analysis of cutting-edge biomedical applications sourced from member universities.&nbsp;Critical to these analyses is the <a href="https://chicagobiomedicalconsortium.org/awards/entrepreneurial-fellows/">Entrepreneurial Fellows</a> Award program, a signature CBC program that McMath will oversee and which was developed in partnership with <a href="https://p33chicago.com/">P33</a>, a privately funded nonprofit charged with elevating Chicagoland’s innovation economy and driving inclusive economic growth.</p>



<p>“Chicago’s life sciences ecosystem is poised to grow rapidly, and the expertise housed at the CBC will be integral. As a partner to CBC’s mission to inclusively grow Chicago’s life sciences ecosystem, we are excited for Dr. McMath to lead the Entrepreneurial Fellows program and help fund some of our best potential applications. Applying industry frameworks to early science commercialization and working with our great scientists will help ensure that the region retains the value of our world class research,” said Brad Henderson, CEO of P33.</p>



<p>The CBC helps commercialize university life sciences projects with $250,000 Accelerator Awards that help traverse the biotech “Valley of Death” between government and venture capital funding.&nbsp;To pick the most promising university projects, the CBC’s Entrepreneurial Fellows, supervised by McMath, perform industry grade due diligence, and confirm funding recommendations with a volunteer board of venture capitalists from 14 different Life Sciences funds. With McMath’s guidance and VC feedback, EFs learn to evaluate academic projects from an industry perspective, a critical skill in Chicagoland’s growing life sciences sector.</p>



<p>The EF program seeks to <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/chicago-innovators-a-four-person-cohort-may-seed-the-biotech-industry-in-chicago/5b1f2fb8-999f-4b66-b66a-d5e2cf948b5f">retain some of the best early career, biomedical research science talent</a> — a diverse group of MDs, PhDs, PharmDs — to work in Chicago’s biotech sector. Fellows receive a generous salary and benefits as they learn on-the-job to evaluate the potential of academic projects to translate to society and US Healthcare markets. After their fellowship, fellows have pledged to work in the Chicagoland ecosystem, building Chicagoland’s life sciences capabilities. By building an inclusive program, P33 and CBC intend to seed the Chicago life sciences ecosystem with diverse life sciences talent.        </p>



<p>Prior to Novartis, McMath advised life sciences companies on commercialization and growth strategy at <a href="http://www.biostrategies.com/index.php">bioStrategies</a> Group, a Chicago-based, boutique consulting firm.&nbsp;McMath received a doctoral degree in genetics from the University of Wisconsin and completed her undergraduate studies at Northwestern University.</p>



<p>Launched in 2006, the CBC is funded by the Searle Funds at the Chicago Community Trust and represents an unprecedented collaboration across three universities each of which is its own biomedical colossus: the University of Illinois Chicago, Northwestern University and the University of Chicago &nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://publichealth.uic.edu/uic-covid-19-public-health-response/uic-covid-19-contact-tracing-and-epidemiology-program/">UIC COVID-19 Contact Tracing and Epidemiology Program</a> — a novel, student-driven program — helped reduce COVID-19 exposures and infections on campus during the 2020-21 academic year, according to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2022.09.025">results published today</a> in the American Journal of Infection Control<em>.</em></p>
<p>The program, which deployed UIC students to conduct COVID-19 case investigations and contact tracing among nonclinical UIC community members, proved to be a highly effective pandemic-response effort in a university setting, the results show. </p>
<p>“Although population-based contact-tracing approaches to help control COVID-19 transmission in U.S. cities have faced significant challenges, our findings suggest that universities are a unique setting where it can be highly effective, particularly when there is strong institutional buy-in for public health interventions,” said Jocelyn Vaughn, research data scientist in the School of Public Health and one of the paper’s lead authors. “Universities should consider utilizing students in COVID-19 and other infectious disease response efforts.”</p>
<p>In August 2020, Vaughn and colleagues created UIC&#8217;s contact tracing program, which was staffed by a fully remote workforce of public health practitioners and trained students. The program was approved by the Chicago Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>“We trained students to conduct both case investigations and contact tracing, which contrasted with the approach taken by most Illinois health departments, but provided both flexibility and cost-effectiveness advantages that contributed to our program’s success,” Vaughn said. “Routine data translation and dissemination, as well as the partnerships we established with CDPH and departments across the university, were also essential.”</p>
<p>Using REDCap, a HIPAA-compliant data-capture and reporting system hosted at UIC, contact tracers interviewed nonclinical students and employees who tested positive for COVID-19 on campus or self-reported their results. Their goal was to reach all cases and contacts within 48 hours of specimen collection or exposure notification.</p>
<p>From Aug. 31, 2020, to May 22, 2021, UIC contact tracers served 1,009 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 746 contacts. Contact tracers reached 96% of cases in about one day from specimen collection, effectively quarantining 120 cases, preventing an estimated 132 downstream exposures and 22 COVID-19 infections. Among 18 identified clusters, contact tracers were able to more than 100 infections, the data shows.</p>
<p>“This program provides exciting evidence that nonclinical university students can be efficiently engaged to provide rapid, thorough and cost-effective investigation and contact tracing to supplement local public health departments’ pandemic response efforts,” said Linda Dickey, president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Negotiations are continuing between the University of Illinois Chicago and UIC United Faculty, the labor union representing the bargaining units of tenure/tenure-track and nontenure-track faculty with 51% time or more, including visiting faculty, at UIC.</p>



<p>Since April 2022, the university and union have held almost 20 bargaining sessions and, recently, an independent mediator from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service was engaged to assist the parties in working toward a resolution.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the union held a strike authorization vote for its members and the result of that vote has not been announced at this time. This vote is advisory to union leadership and does not mean that a strike is imminent. Before a strike can occur, the union must provide the university with a 10-day notice of intent to strike. That has not occurred.</p>



<p>With 14 of 23 issues agreed upon to date and mostly economic articles yet to be resolved, the university remains fully committed to good-faith bargaining and the mediation process. At the beginning of negotiations, both UIC and UICUF agreed to first focus solely on resolving non-economic issues. The parties began exchanging proposals to address key economic issues in October. UIC believes continuing dialogue is the best path forward to come to a mutual agreement on the outstanding articles in the union contract.</p>



<p>The next bargaining session is scheduled for Nov. 22.</p>



<p>While negotiations progress, updates will continue to be provided to the campus community at <a href="https://facultybargaining.uic.edu">facultybargaining.uic.edu</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago has been named to <a href="https://allinchallenge.org/">ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge</a>’s inaugural <a href="https://allinchallenge.org/most-engaged-campuses/">ALL IN Most Engaged Campuses for College Student Voting</a> recognition program. This program recognizes participating institutions that worked to increase nonpartisan student voter registration, education and turnout and ensure equitable access to the polls for their campus community.</p>

<p>UIC joins a group of 394 colleges and universities acknowledged by ALL IN for meeting four core requirements:</p>



<ul><li>Participated in the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge.</li><li>Shared a 2020 National Study of Learning Voting and Engagement Report with campus voting data with ALL IN.</li><li>Developed and submitted a 2022 democratic engagement action plan with ALL IN.</li><li>Have a current signatory to ALL IN’s Higher Education Presidents’ Commitment to Full Student Voter Participation.</li></ul>



<p>UIC also earned ALL IN’s Highly Established Action Plan Seal of recognition, which identifies higher education institutions with strong action plans to increase nonpartisan democratic engagement by promoting civic learning, political engagement and college student voter participation. Action plan strength is determined by reviewing campus action plans with the Strengthening American Democracy Action Planning Rubric.</p>



<p>Among UIC&#8217;s various efforts are annual events, such as Constitution Day, National Voter Registration Day, the National Student Issues Convention and the Future of Chicago Speaker Series, which afford students, staff and faculty the opportunity for democratic engagement throughout the year.</p>



<p>UIC serves as a City of Chicago voting site, and thousands of students cast their ballots on campus each election cycle. Before the Nov. 8 election, UIC transitioned from being a university early voting site with three days of voting to be the primary early voting site for Chicago’s 34th Ward.</p>



<p>Among units at UIC that lead the university’s civic engagement efforts are UIC Government Relations and Advocacy, the UIC Alumni Association, Student Leadership and Civic Engagement, and the Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement.</p>



<p>“The research is clear: colleges and universities that make intentional efforts to increase nonpartisan democratic engagement have higher campus voter registration and voter turnout rates. Despite ongoing obstacles, these campuses have remained dedicated in their commitment to ensuring that their students are informed and confident voters,” said Jennifer Domagal-Goldman, executive director of the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge.</p>



<p>Last year, UIC earned its third Voter Friendly Campus designation from the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, the national organization of student affairs administrators in higher education, and the Fair Elections Center’s Campus Vote Project. In 2020, Washington Monthly magazine named UIC one of the nation’s best universities for student voting. </p>



<p>The ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge, a national nonpartisan initiative of the nonprofit Civic Nation, currently engages over 9 million students from more than 950 institutions in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>Flames student-athletes achieved a school record 93% graduation rate in the most recent release of academic success data by the NCAA. A two-point increase over last year&#8217;s record of 91%, it marks the seventh consecutive year that UIC has raised its student-athlete graduation rate (from 82% in 2016 to 93% this year).<br /> <br />&#8220;Academic achievement is a point of pride for UIC student-athletes, who are as competitive in the classroom as they are in competition,&#8221; Director of Athletics Michael Lipitz said. &#8220;Their collective academic success in recent years is truly remarkable. Special thanks to our faculty, coaches and academic services staff for their collective support.&#8221;<br /> <br />Eight Flames teams posted perfect 100% graduation rates: volleyball, men&#8217;s tennis, women&#8217;s tennis, women&#8217;s soccer, women&#8217;s golf, women&#8217;s cross country and track and field, women&#8217;s basketball, and women&#8217;s swimming and diving. For volleyball, this marks 12 consecutive years graduating 100% of its student-athletes. Women&#8217;s soccer, women&#8217;s swimming and diving, and women&#8217;s tennis each notched perfect results for the fourth straight year.<br /> <br />UIC softball and men&#8217;s swimming and diving also posted strong graduation rates, with both programs recording a 94% graduation rate.<br /> <br />This fall&#8217;s graduation rate announcement follows a spring semester in which UIC student-athletes combined to record a 3.27 GPA, the 16th consecutive semester above a 3.0 for the Flames. One-third of UIC&#8217;s 300 student-athletes earned Dean&#8217;s List honors with GPAs of 3.5 or higher, while 66 recorded perfect 4.0 GPAs. The Flames tennis programs burned brightest in the classroom last spring, with the men&#8217;s squad earning a 3.64 GPA and the women&#8217;s squad leading all UIC teams with a 3.88 GPA.<br /> <br />&#8220;These incredible GSR numbers are a direct result of the continued dedication and commitment of our student-athletes, coaches, administration, and the entire UIC campus community,&#8221; said Karen Dixon, associate athletics director for academic services. &#8220;I am tremendously proud of our Flames student-athletes and the championship mindset they bring to their academic pursuits every day.&#8221;<br /> </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Researchers trace the movement of obsidian artifacts across the Andes ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A University of Illinois Chicago archeologist and colleagues used an &#8220;X-ray gun&#8221; to examine ancient obsidian artifacts from Peru, and in a newly published article, they report on the region’s cultural interactions and systems of exchange.  </p>

<p>In a paper in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X22003649">Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</a>, David Reid and colleagues detail how they used portable X-ray fluorescence to trace the movement of obsidian artifacts across the Andes to the Middle Moquegua Valley during the Middle Horizon period over 1,000 years ago.</p>



<p>A total of 50 obsidian artifacts housed in the Museo Contisuyu in Moquegua, Peru, were analyzed from 10 archaeological sites affiliated with Tiwanaku, Wari and indigenous Huaracane groups across the Formative Period and Middle Horizon eras (C.E. 600-1000).</p>



<p>Notably, their analysis finds obsidian tools and materials crossed social boundaries between the expansive Tiwanaku and Wari states along their only known shared frontier in Moquegua.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This study demonstrates that even when state colonists maintain strict cultural identities tied to homeland regions, such rigid social boundaries are rarely impermeable, and social networks may cross-cut traditional divisions,” said Reid, UIC postdoctoral research associate in anthropology.</p>



<p>Over half of the obsidians utilized by Tiwanaku were found to correspond with Wari-affiliated sources.</p>



<p>The exchange between expansionary states likely occurred due to sociopolitical factors, according to the researchers, who also note that further investigation is needed to determine whether this exchange was through peaceful trade and social interaction, scavenging, plunder or even literal “exchanges” of arrows in volleys.</p>



<p>Co-authors of the study are Paul Goldstein of the University of California, San Diego, and Patrick Ryan Williams of UIC and the Field Museum of Natural History.</p>



<p>This work was supported by funding obtained by Goldstein from the Fulbright-Hays, Wenner Gren, HJ Heinz III foundations and National Science Foundation awards (9809720 and 1067986). Assistance was also received via the Elemental Analysis Facility at the Field Museum, which has been funded by the W. W. Grainger Foundation, the Negaunee Foundation and the National Science Foundation (BCS-1628026, 1531394, 1321731, 0818401, and 0320903).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The UIC Department of Pharmacology and Regenerative Medicine in the [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UIC Department of Pharmacology and Regenerative Medicine in the College of Medicine first awarded a Program Project Grant from National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health in March 2000.</p>
<p>Since then, the department has been continuously home to two Program Project Grants. These multi-investigator current projects totaling over $22,000,000 center on &#8220;Macrophage Plasticity in Inflammatory Lung Injury&#8221; (program director Asrar B. Malik) and &#8220;The Lung Endothelium as an Instructive Niche for the Innate Immune System during vascular Injury&#8221; (program director Dolly Mehta). These current P01s, as well as additional long-term funding from NIH, DOD and NSF, contribute to the department’s status as one of the top-funded departments at UIC and pharmacology departments nationwide.</p>
<p>P01 awards are unique, as they “support broad multidisciplinary, long-term research programs involving groups of investigators working on research projects that contribute to the overall program objectives.” These grants have spurred numerous research collaborations both within the department and the university as a whole, as well as with other institutions, leading to transformative research projects and contributions.</p>
<p>In addition, seven multi-PI R01s and R33s were recently funded, indicating the intense level of collaborations within the Department.  A snapshot of these projects include &#8220;Programming of PMN host-defense function during transendothelial migration,&#8221; &#8220;Optogenetic control of tumor Initiation and tumor progression in vivo,&#8221; and &#8220;Mechanisms and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 induced lung endothelial injury.&#8221; In addition, multiple large research programs have recently been awarded to researchers in the department (including <a href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-awarded-6-million-to-develop-potential-covid-19-treatment/">DOD Technology Award</a> and <a href="https://today.uic.edu/six-uic-scholars-win-nsf-career-awards/">NSF Career Awards</a>).</p>
<p>These Program Project Grants have contributed to and indeed are the major drivers of the rich collaborative environment of the department. Under the leadership of Malik as department head, the department is home to a highly interactive and intellectually robust group of researchers.</p>
<p>This setting has been essential for the  success of new junior faculty members; four new faculty members have recently received independent R01 or R33 grants from NIH, demonstrating their strengths and the demanding nature of the intellectually rigorous environment. These investigators include Sandra Pinho (&#8220;Mechanisms of hematopoietic stem cell engraftment&#8221;), Kiwook Kim (&#8220;Role of membrane-associated macrophages in health and inflammation&#8221;), Dr. Soroush Tahmasebi (&#8220;Translational regulation of tissue resident macrophages by GCN2<em>&#8220;) </em>and Gary Mo (&#8220;Pyroptosis is a Trial-by-Fire Program&#8221;).</p>
<p>The department is also a recipient of a major Training Program supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the NIH. This NIH-sponsored institutional training program, currently in its 29th year, was borne out of our commitment to providing comprehensive training of the next generation of creative and meritorious lung researchers at the predoctoral and postdoctoral levels. The training program emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of cutting-edge research in an environment that fosters independent and creative thinking. The primary objective of the program has been training future research leaders. The success of trainees, both in receipt of independent funding and career development reflects the success of the department’s collaborative training mechanisms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Marie Lynn Miranda, the former provost of the University of Notre Dame and a leader in the drive to make higher education more inclusive, has been named chancellor of the University of Illinois Chicago and a vice president of the University of Illinois System.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/20221111_uicchancellorwelcomeevent_mf_0445-1/"><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="393" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-590x393.jpg" alt="Marie Lynn Miranda" class="wp-image-138936" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-590x393.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-387x258.jpg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-1320x880.jpg 1320w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a><figcaption>Marie Lynn Miranda will take office July 5, 2023, as the 10th chancellor of UIC. (Photo: Mike Fan)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Pending formal approval by the Board of Trustees at its Nov. 17 meeting, Miranda will take office July 5, 2023, as the 10th chancellor of UIC. She will succeed Chancellor Michael Amiridis, who became President of the University of South Carolina in June.</p>



<p>Miranda, 59, served as provost at Notre Dame through 2021 and remains a member of the faculty in its Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics. As provost, she led the private university’s academic response to the COVID-19 pandemic; helped drive efforts to increase faculty and student diversity, resulting in the most diverse first-year class in school history in 2021; started a transformational leaders program to provide resources to students from under-served backgrounds; and led a bottom up strategic planning process that engaged more than 600 members of the faculty.</p>



<p>Miranda brings a wide range of other leadership experience at Rice University, the University of Michigan and Duke University to her new role as chancellor of UIC and its nearly 34,000 students and 13,000 faculty and staff.</p>



<p>“It is an honor to be chosen to lead one of the country’s great urban universities and to serve this global city and its people,” Miranda said. “I look forward to learning from and working with students, faculty and staff as we work collaboratively with our community partners to meet the pressing challenges and opportunities before us. Together we can provide life-changing educational programs at scale, while fostering the world-class research and engagement our city, state, country and world need.”</p>



<p>University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen said Miranda’s deep experience as a higher education innovator dedicated to access, excellence and community engagement will serve UIC well.</p>



<p>“Marie Lynn comes to UIC and the University of Illinois System as a champion for higher education, a believer in the undisputable impact that a great university can have on the lives of its students, their families and the communities it serves,” Killeen said. “She has been a leader in making certain that higher education is accessible to more and more people, a public good that should be available to students from all backgrounds and income levels. I look forward to working with her to advance UIC and the U of I System.”</p>



<p>At Notre Dame, Miranda is also director of the Children&#8217;s Environmental Health Initiative (CEHI), a research, education and outreach organization committed to fostering environments where all people can prosper. The initiative is best known for its work on childhood lead exposure – contributing to the CDC’s decision to set a more protective standard for childhood blood lead levels, developing strategies for combatting lead in drinking water, and identifying lead in aviation gasoline as a contributor to elevated blood lead levels. CEHI’s most recent work focuses on racial residential segregation and the ways segregated neighborhoods experience greater exposure to social and environmental stressors, which in turn drives health and educational disparities.</p>



<p>Before joining Notre Dame in 2020, Miranda was provost at Rice University from 2015-19. She was responsible for all aspects of the university’s academic, research, scholarly and creative programs, supported by a roughly $700 million annual budget. While at Rice, Miranda also led planning and implementation of $230 million in investments focused on areas such as molecular nanotechnology, data sciences, neuroengineering, inequities and inequalities and general research competitiveness. Her efforts at Rice also included providing a comprehensive set of programs for students from under-served backgrounds – an initiative which substantially closed graduation and time to degree gaps.</p>



<p>At Michigan, Miranda was dean of what was then the School of Natural Resources and Environment from 2012-15, restructuring the doctoral program and improving degree-completion metrics; developing data systems to support evidence-based decision-making in admissions and advising; and reinvigorating the department’s alumni relations operation.</p>



<p>Prior to her work at Michigan, Miranda spent 21 years as a member of the faculty at Duke University, including nine years as director of undergraduate programs for the Nicholas School of the Environment. She also was principal investigator of a research laboratory with roughly 30 full-time staff and 40-plus faculty collaborators. Over the course of her research career, Miranda has been principal investigator or co-principal investigator on over $75 million dollars in research funding.</p>



<p>She is a Phi Beta Kappa, <em>summa cum laude</em> graduate of Duke University, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and economics and was named a Truman Scholar. She has a PhD and Master of Arts from Harvard University, where she held a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.</p>



<p>Miranda is also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>



<p>She was chosen from five finalists and a pool of 40 well-qualified applicants. A committee chaired by UIC Interim Provost and Professor Karen Colley advised system Executive Vice President Avijit Ghosh and Killeen in the search.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Keith Naylor, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine<br /></strong>Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology<br />Director, Gastrointestinal Cancer Prevention Program<br />Co-Chair, Illinois Cancer partnership Screening and Early Detection Subcommittee<br />Co-Lead, Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative Outreach Core</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Examining colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer screening and diagnosis among Chicago Community Health Center patients during the COVID-19 pandemic&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, causing over 600,000 deaths each year. However, many of the most common cancers are highly treatable, or in some cases preventable, with appropriate cancer screening and early detection. Cancer screening can be described as tests that are intended to detect or diagnose cancers in individuals who have no signs or symptoms of cancer. Many cancer screening tests are recommended for healthy men and women as a part of their routine preventative health care, based on age, sex at birth, family history of cancer, as well as other risk factors.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, the cancer death rate has decreased by over 25% in large part due to increased cancer screening and advances in treatment. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions in multiple aspects of health care, including cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment. Nationwide, at the onset of the pandemic, there was an estimated 90% decrease in breast cancer screening, 79% decrease in colon cancer screening, and a 63% decrease in prostate cancer screening. Presently, it is not known how these declines impacted racial/ethnic minority populations, or how they may affect cancer diagnosis and survivorship.</p>
<p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, safety-net health systems, including public hospitals, have served a crucial role in providing health care to the uninsured and individuals with Medicaid insurance. As a vital component of the safety-net health system, Community Health Centers provide comprehensive primary health care services to many communities of color and the medically underserved. In Chicago, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdown caused severe disruptions in health care delivery, including hospitals canceling many elective procedures, such as cancer screening exams, and CHCs limiting in-person visits where cancer screenings often occur.</p>
<p>Chicagoans living in medically underserved community areas, who rely on CHCs for cancer-related screening and other care, may be particularly vulnerable to these disruptions due to the complex interaction of individual, social, and health-system-level factors that are known to contribute to cancer-related health disparities. To achieve health equity and eliminate cancer-related disparities, it is essential to understand which individuals and community areas were impacted most by the pandemic-related effects on cancer screening and diagnosis.</p>
<p>Through research supported by the University of Illinois Cancer Center Community Outreach and Engagement Office, and in collaboration with the Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative, we are examining the impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening rates and subsequent care among patients seen at Alliance Chicago affiliate Community Health Centers.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we are reviewing cancer screening-related information obtained from the Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN). CAPriCORN-affiliated health care organizations include: 392 primary care clinics and 32 hospitals that serve over 12 million patients across Cook County. From this wealth of information, we hope to learn more regarding how cancer screening and diagnosis at Chicago’s CHCs changed over the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>About Our Researcher</strong><br />Dr. Naylor is an assistant professor of clinical medicine and a practicing gastroenterologist at the University of Illinois Chicago and co-lead of the Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative Outreach Core. His clinical focus in the diagnosis and management of hereditary and familial gastrointestinal cancer syndromes, as well as colorectal cancer screening and prevention. Dr. Naylor directs the Gastrointestinal Cancer Prevention Program at the University of Illinois Health Center, and he is the acting co-chair of the Illinois Cancer Partnership’s Screening and Early Detection subcommittee. Dr. Naylor’s research centers on using administrative health data to investigate variation in the utilization and quality of cancer related health care, with specific focus on increasing the utilization of care among social racial and ethnic minority patient populations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Safe Exchange Zone offers safe environment for personal sales transactions]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The beginning of the holiday season is a good time to remind online shoppers that while great deals can be found on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Next Door and other community-based websites, there can be dangers associated with meeting a stranger.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, these type of websites can be also used by criminals who intend to take advantage of good-faith buyers or sellers,” UIC Police Chief Kevin Booker said. “In light of recent incidents on campus and in the city, we want to ensure that members of the UIC community can complete this type of sales transaction in a safe way.”</p>
<p>That’s why UICPD has established its police station lobby, 943 W. Maxwell St., as a Safe Exchange Zone in which community members can conduct personal sales transactions in a safe, neutral environment that is comfortable, well-lit and under video surveillance 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement and university staff will not be involved in any way with the transactions,” Booker said. “We even provide designated parking spaces for the parties involved. These arrangements prevent crime from occurring — especially if one of the participants refuses to meet at our location. That’s a sign that they may be up to no good.”</p>
<p>If you must conduct transactions at another location, visit the <a href="https://police.uic.edu/services/safe-exchange-zone/">Safe Exchange Zone webpage</a> for helpful tips about how to stay safe during the sales process.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Realignment aims to support UIC's student success mission]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>University leadership hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvN7TciWogk">Q&amp;A session</a> Nov. 2 to answer questions from the UIC community about the <a href="https://today.uic.edu/re-imagining-and-realigning-student-success/">realignment of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs</a>, which aims to support UIC’s student success mission.</p>
<p>UIC community members asked questions in person during the event at Student Center East and had the opportunity to submit questions and watch virtually.</p>
<p>Panelists included Interim Chancellor Javier Reyes; Karen Colley, acting provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs; Rob Dixon, interim vice chancellor and vice provost for student affairs; Dan Williams, associate vice chancellor for business services; Fred McCall, associate vice chancellor for student engagement <span class="TextRun SCXW181382133 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW181382133 BCX0">and interim dean of students</span></span>; Raphael Florestal-Kevelier, assistant vice chancellor for student health and wellness; Josephine Volpe, associate vice provost for advising development; Kiely Fletcher, associate vice provost for enrollment management; and Aisha El-Amin, associate vice provost for student success and belonging.</p>
<p>Reyes shared the history of the realignment process, which began under the leadership of Rex Tolliver, former vice chancellor for student affairs. The realignment, which officially took effect Oct. 16, creates the new position of vice chancellor and vice provost for student affairs to oversee student affairs, advising, enrollment management and student success initiatives. Dixon is serving in the interim position, and a search will take place after UIC’s next chancellor is named.</p>
<p>“We really had our student life cycle really split between four great leaders that had incredible goals and had incredible plans, but they were not necessarily aligning in how they were getting there,” Reyes said. “The alignment of the mission and structure was what we needed to work on.”</p>
<p>Reyes acknowledged that the university needs to understand and address areas where the university has reached a plateau or has gaps in enrollment, such as African American enrollment and retention of our first-year students and freshmen.</p>
<p>Reyes presented organizational charts that show new reporting lines, and Dixon stressed that all current staff members were retained in the realignment process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colley said the realignment will foster collaboration among Student Affairs and Academic Affairs to better support UIC students.</p>
<p>“The realignment will remove structural barriers that exist right now and allow increased collaboration across all of student services to ensure that student concerns are navigated in a holistic manner with both professionals from Student Affairs and Academic Affairs at the table,” she said. “It will also allow Student Affairs and Academic Affairs to speak as one and to act as a group to identify and address challenges to student success.”</p>
<p>The realignment will support students in many ways, Colley said. For example, it will allow for better coordination between student success units and enrollment services in UIC&#8217;s recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>“We’ll be able to better leverage the community in connections and talents in the leadership of the student success units to enhance recruitment efforts together with the recruiters from enrollment services,” she said.</p>
<p>Colley said other coordinated efforts created by the realignment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing together financial aid, admissions and recruitment professionals to create funding packages for admissions offers rather than sending aid packages only to admitted students.</li>
<li>Enhancing proactive advising strategies to support student success, engagement and well-being.</li>
<li>Ensuring that students are aware of health and wellness resources available to them at UIC as early as during the recruitment process.</li>
<li>Identifying services to support historically underrepresented student populations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next 12 to 18 months, Reyes said, university leadership will target efforts to increase student engagement for all students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we have an alignment at the leadership that can do that,&#8221; Reyes said.</p>
<p>A video of the Q&amp;A session can be viewed online. Additional questions that were not addressed during the session are answered below.</p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: What general student affairs support and accommodations can be offered to students in regional campuses (i.e. Rockford and Peoria)?&nbsp; </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><strong>A:</strong> Each year the Student Fee Advisory Committee, through the student fee setting process makes recommendations for support of the UIC off-site campuses (Rockford, Peoria, and Quad Cities).&nbsp; For this fiscal year (FY 2023) it is projected that the off-site campuses would receive more than $1.7 million in student fee support.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: How will/should the realignment impact committee structure at the college and departmental levels?  </span></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> There aren’t plans to change the existence of campus-level committees such as Dean’s Council, Committee of Associate and Assistant Deans for Student and Academic Affairs (CAAD), etc. where colleges make up the membership. This realignment does provide opportunity for more communication with student affairs areas but would not largely change those internal structures in the colleges.</p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: How will this realignment of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs impact student affairs or academic advising units that occur within the colleges, where reporting lines are internal to the college? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><strong>A:</strong> The realignment will not impact reporting lines internal to the college. Student Affairs will continue to collaborate with college-specific Student Affairs/Advising on orientation, addressing student concerns, and university-wide initiatives focused on student success. </span><span data-contrast="auto">For academic advising units and student affairs units within the colleges, reporting lines will not be changing, which means that our plans for advising development are to increase our partnership and the intention is to have as much positive impact as possible while we know that there will be challenges, one of the commitments advising development is making is to work collaboratively with the college officers to understand the areas that are working best, the pain points, and where we can work to make changes that will engender positive outcomes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: When students feel most vulnerable and need support services to be inviting and accessible, what are succinct ways to make them available for immediate use? How can we enhance the use of our social media, infographics, and other prominent ways to make supports visible? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><strong>A:</strong> There are a variety of supports available for students experiencing situations that require emergency intervention. In addition to the direct support resources (e.g. Counseling Centers, Wellness Center/Pop-up food pantry, Dean of Students office, UIC Police Department, Housing, etc.), there are bodies of colleagues including the Student Care Team and Student Response Team that convene to coordinate assistance for students navigating complex issues (e.g. housing, food, financial challenges, etc.) leveraging the vast array of supports available within UIC and the broader Chicago community. With the realignment, there are opportunities to streamline these support structures, expand community capacity (particularly among our student-facing colleagues), to provide immediate support and connect students to resources available when they need them. It is also important to note that the needed supports and the institutional responses vary based on each student’s situation and context, and warrant intentional collaboration for the best possible outcomes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: You mentioned that this realignment will allow for Academic Affairs and Student Affairs to come together with one voice. What has been created to ensure there is intentional staff engagement with both areas to blend the variety of cultures that exist to be more cohesive?</span></b></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong><span style="color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Meetings with Student Affairs leadership spanning both former areas will be held consistently.&nbsp; Leaders at the director level will gather among colleagues in traditionally formulated organizations to discuss the realignment. Then in early January, all realigned student affairs directors will gather for a meet and greet and brainstorming session to look for new collaborations. Events to bring all staff together will continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Q: Are there discussions about how to strategically re-organize office spaces to support the goal of more collaboration across units?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>A:</strong> Staff to support Student Success and Belonging will be moving into Student Services Building.&nbsp; Moving office spaces is an interesting idea to foster collaboration.&nbsp; In upcoming meetings, this idea could be raised and further examined.</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Q: How will we know if this realignment is </span></b><strong>working?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>A:</strong> Metrics for success, such as coordination of financial aid awards, or event/service collaboration, will need to emerge from the units. <span class="NormalTextRun TrackChangeHoverSelectHighlightRed SCXW5955018 BCX0">Student Affairs teams are formulating plans and metrics</span><span class="NormalTextRun TrackChangeHoverSelectHighlightRed SCXW5955018 BCX0">,</span><span class="NormalTextRun TrackChangeHoverSelectHighlightRed SCXW5955018 BCX0"> with</span> input from directors and staff, which will be shared with the campus in the spring.</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Q: I am thrilled to hear the recurring theme of collaboration between professional staff and programs. This highlights how important staff, possibly increased staff, is to all being discussed. Education is a labor-intensive effort! How will the efforts of the campus Human Resources area and the Student Affairs Human Resources area be supported and aligned for expedient and effective search and hire processes? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>A:</strong> Within the last four months, campus Human Resources has implemented two new computer </span> <span data-contrast="auto">programs that will aid in making the search and hiring process more efficient. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Student Affairs Human Resources has operated for over six months with several </span> <span data-contrast="auto">vacancies including the executive director position. As of this writing, the Student </span> <span data-contrast="auto">Affairs Executive Director has been hired. The next step will be to hire the Senior Human </span> <span data-contrast="auto">Resources position and add additional staff to support the student employment and civil </span> <span data-contrast="auto">service hiring processes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>For eight weeks, artist Mario Mena led a summer arts class where students put down their thoughts on the environment and the land under their feet.</p>



<p>Working with 12 students from Yollocalli Arts Reach’s Street Art Class as well as the 12 students in the UIC Heritage Garden’s summer internship program, they created the yet unnamed mural, which recently was dedicated outside the UIC Latino Cultural Center during a Day of the Dead celebration.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/latino-cultural-center-director-rosa-cabrera-helps-dedicate-the/"><img loading="lazy" width="387" height="258" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-387x258.jpeg" alt="Rosa Cabrera in front of a colorful mural celebrating urban pollinators" class="wp-image-138598" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-387x258.jpeg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-590x393.jpeg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-1320x880.jpeg 1320w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4.jpeg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /></a><figcaption>Latino Cultural Center Director Rosa Cabrera helps dedicate the new mural outside of the center.

<p>“Not only did they learn, but I learned a lot working with the youth to create a beautiful image that reflects our Earth and our land,” said Mena, who leads the Street Art Class through Yollocalli Arts Reach, an award winning youth initiative of the National Museum of Mexican Art.</p>



<p>The theme of the mural is the conservation of urban pollinators. It depicts two large colorful monarch butterflies alongside other pollinators flying in a sky of orange and yellow over green fields, as billowing smokestacks spew dark plumes of smoke in the background.</p>



<p>Funding came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service to the UIC Latino Cultural Center and the Heritage Garden.</p>

<p>The work is part of the Engaging Diverse Audiences in Monarch Conservation project meant to highlight the Heritage Garden’s monarch butterfly habitat, said Ireri Unzueta Carrasco, lead coordinator and Heritage Garden educator.</p>



<p>Latino Cultural Center Director Rosa Cabrera said the mural, which will be temporarily removed to prepare it for permanent installation, serves to beautify the campus and support our students’ journey at UIC as they “create cultural and artistic responses to social and environmental issues that many of our students are facing.”</p>
