<H3> Course Objective </h3>
<p>This course aims to introduce the field of Artificial Intelligence.

<center> <h3> Think and Ask! </h3> </center>
<p> If you have questions about any topic or assignment, DO ASK me, TA or 
even your classmates for help. I am here to help and to make the course 
understood. DO NOT delay your questions. There is no such thing as a 
stupid question. The only obstacle to learning is laziness. Please use

<H3> Rules and Policies </H3> 
<uL>
<li> <b>Statute of limitations</b>: No grading questions or complaints, no matter how justified, will be listened to one week after the item in question has been returned. 
<li> <b>Cheating</b>: Cheating will not be tolerated. All work you submitted must be entirely your own. Any suspicious similarities between students' work (this includes, exams and program) will be recorded and brought to the attention of the Dean. The MINIMUM penalty for any student found cheating will be to receive a 0 for the item in question, and dropping your final course grade one letter. The MAXIMUM penalty will be expulsion from the University. 
<li> <b>MOSS</b>: Sharing code with your classmates is not acceptable!!! All programs will be screened using the Moss (Measure of Software Similarity.) system. 
<li> <b>Late assignments</b>: Late assignments will not, in general, be accepted. They will never be accepted if the student has not made special arrangements with me at least one day before the assignment is due. If a late assignment is accepted it is subject to a reduction in score as a late penalty.
