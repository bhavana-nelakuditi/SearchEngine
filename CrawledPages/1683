<p>David Martinez is the 2022 recipient of the Merit Award from the University of Illinois Chicago’s Division of Specialized Care for Children.</p>
<p>The award recognizes exceptional employees for outstanding dedication and service to Illinois children with special healthcare needs and their families.</p>
<p>Martinez is a care coordinator in the Chicago Central Office. In this role, he helps families develop personalized care plans for their children’s unique needs and connects them to the right services and resources.</p>
<p>“David has a remarkable ability to partner with our participant families and empower them to help reach their full potential,” DSCC Executive Director Thomas F. Jerkovitz said. “He works with families from a variety of cultural backgrounds and helps them feel understood and able to navigate the systems involved in their child’s care.”</p>
<p>His teammates say Martinez has a talent for helping families and working magic in situations where others might not see a way.</p>
<p>“He is culturally sensitive, proactive and able to put himself in other people’s shoes so that he can better understand their situation and how best to partner with them to find a solution,” said Patricia Perez, assistant director of research and practice initiative and former Chicago Central regional manager.</p>
<p>Martinez is a licensed clinical social worker. He grew up in El Salvador and studied criminal justice after coming to the United States.</p>
<p>He provided substance abuse programs at the Cook County Jail before deciding to pursue social work. This decision stemmed from his desire to help others and make an impact on families as early as possible.</p>
<p>Martinez worked in mental health before joining DSCC in April 2016. He says he is honored to work for DSCC and with his amazing colleagues and managers in the Chicago Central office.</p>
<p>“Building strong relationships with my co-workers and the families we serve energizes me every single day,” Martinez said. “Our families’ needs go beyond just medical. Every day is an opportunity to look at a situation from all different aspects and find a solution that can meet their needs. Sometimes it’s as simple as just listening.”</p>
<p>Martinez said his DSCC career has helped him learn about many different cultures and that care coordination is not one-size-fits-all.</p>
<p>“Meeting the family where they are – that’s my starting point,” Martinez said. “When I’m meeting with families, I tell them we are a team.”</p>
<p>Martinez has helped achieve many successful outcomes for his participant families. In early 2022, he secured a $36,000 grant through the Guaranteed Rate Foundation to purchase and install a vehicle wheelchair lift in a participant family’s van and to make their bathroom wheelchair accessible.</p>
<p>But Martinez says his proudest achievements are the relationships he builds with families.</p>
<p>“It would be impossible for me to deliver my passion in social work without having a relationship with families and open communication,” Martinez said. “To be able to talk to families on a monthly basis and help them navigate through issues in life, that is my biggest accomplishment — having the trust the families place in me and DSCC.”</p>
<p>Our DSCC team nominated a total of 12 of our colleagues for this year’s Merit Award. As the winner, Martinez receives a Merit Award memento, a $2,500 award and recognition from the executive director.</p>
<p>The other 2022 nominees are:</p>

<li>Melissa Croft, Home Care Enrollment Specialist, Lombard Regional Office.</li>
<li>Christina “Tina” Glim, Care Coordinator, Mokena Regional Office.</li>
<li>Kristin Grubb, Administrative Aide, Peoria Regional Office.</li>

<p><strong>Dilip Pandey, MD, PhD, FAHA</strong><br />
Associate Professor<br />
University of Illinois at Chicago<br />
Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Enhancing self-management and quality of life for adults with Epilepsy: PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy at UIC&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction<br />
</strong> People with epilepsy have diverse social backgrounds and educational skillsets; therefore, self-management education for improving their condition is challenging. The PAUSE study evaluated mobile technology-based personalized epilepsy self-management education intervention in improving self-management behaviors, epilepsy outcome expectations, quality of life and personal impact of epilepsy in adults with epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology<br />
</strong> UIC Institutional Review Board approved PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy. Between October 2015 and March 2019, 112 people with epilepsy were recruited at the UI Health epilepsy outpatient clinic and consented to participate.<br />
An Android-based application to provide tailored self-management education intervention was developed for PAUSE. An individualized eight-to-12 week education intervention, utilizing an internet-enabled computer tablet application with download customized to patient-specific educational needs from Epilepsy.com, was provided to the study participants. Participants progressed the learning modules of individualized educational program at their own pace and returned the study computer tablet at the end of intervention period.</p>
<p>Validated self-reported questionnaires were used to obtain outcome measures. Participants were assessed at baseline, the first follow-up at completion of the intervention, and the second follow-up at least three months after the first follow-up.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br />
</strong> There were significant improvements in all self-management behaviors, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, quality of life and personal impact of epilepsy measures from baseline to first follow-up. This study showed feasibility of a mobile-based personalized epilepsy self-management intervention in improving self-management skills and behavior, quality of life for people with epilepsy in clinical settings. This underscores a greater need for a community-based trial to test the effectiveness of personalized self-management education, such as PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy, in broader settings specifically for the unique needs of the hard-to-reach and hard-to-treat population of people with epilepsy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Arthington Mall Plaza is the first SITES certification for UIC and the University of Illinois System]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.sustainablesites.org/node/8497">Arthington Mall Plaza</a> has been certified by the Sustainable SITES Initiative. This is the first SITES certification for UIC and the University of Illinois System, and only the 10th SITES recognition in higher education nationwide.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sustainablesites.org/">Sustainable SITES Initiative</a> offers a comprehensive rating system designed to distinguish sustainable landscapes, measure their performance and elevate their value. It is used in private and public sectors all around the world. Just as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Rating has transformed the built environment, SITES transforms land development and use and believes these types of certifications are critical to ensure projects meet the highest standards.</p>
<p>Arthington Mall Plaza is a central crossroads on the UIC campus and is located directly outside of Student Center West in the Illinois Medical District. The plaza was renovated in 2020 from a stark paved courtyard in need of repair into a vibrant and welcoming outdoor space that encourages gathering, mitigates stormwater runoff, and provides critical urban habitat for pollinators and other species.</p>
<p>“Obtaining SITES certification is one of many third-party collaborations, highlighting the importance of sustainability here at UIC,” said Carly Provost-Rizor, director of grounds services.</p>
<p>The renovation was a joint effort between UIC, the National Fish Wildlife Foundation and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. NFWF and MWRD generously provided $442,000 in funding for the project. The renovation included an intensive landscaping process guided by the <a href="https://sustainability.uic.edu/plans/uicclimatecommitments/">UIC Climate Commitments</a>, the <a href="https://sustainability.uic.edu/green-campus/grounds/green-stormwater-infrastructure/arthington-mall-plaza/">Urban Transformation 2.0: Green Stormwater Infrastructure Implementation Plan</a> and the <a href="https://cppm.uic.edu/planning/2018-implementation-plan/">UIC Master Plan</a>.</p>
<p>“UIC’s Climate Action Implementation Plan is an invaluable tool. This resource guides our sustainability and SITES certification goals, both of which are key components of every major landscape project,” Provost-Rizor said.</p>

Romanucci will be the keynote speaker for the 2022 undergraduate ceremony. Photo provided.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The commencement speaker for the undergraduate ceremony will be Antonio M. Romanucci, a national civil rights and personal injury attorney and co-founding partner of Romanucci &amp; Blandin, LLC. Romanucci is a graduate of the former The John Marshall Law School, which was acquired by the university in 2019 and renamed the UIC School of Law.</p>



<p>Starting as a Cook County public defender, he has progressed to being one of the leading civil rights attorneys in the country. He was named the No. 1 civil rights lawyer in 2022 by Leading Lawyers and was selected as<em> </em>Chicago Lawyer magazine’s 2021 Person of the Year. Additionally, he was recently recognized by Chicago Magazine<em> </em>on their ‘New Power 30’ list for his many contributions to the Chicago community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Romanucci is considered the “architect” of the historic civil rights lawsuit and settlement against the City of Minneapolis while co-representing the estate of George Floyd. His national presence is on behalf of many who have suffered due to corporate or individual negligence and his cases include those who lost loved ones on a Boeing 737 Max aircraft, those who were made sick by ethylene oxide emissions in Willowbrook, Illinois, and victims of mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, Las Vegas and Highland Park, Illinois.</p>



<p>He is active in a number of professional associations, such as the American Association for Justice, as well as civic and charitable organizations for children, including St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, where he was honorary chair of the annual fundraising gala in Chicago in 2020.</p>



<p>Romanucci works to educate the next generation by sharing his experiences as an attorney advocating for plaintiffs and for civil justice in and out of the courtroom. He shares this message as he speaks on college campuses, to fellow lawyers, bar associations and community groups. Romanucci has been a guest lecturer to students at the UIC School of Law as well as a speaker at other UIC events, including the University’s Minority Health Conference titled “Bridging the Gap” in Fall 2022.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The University of Illinois Chicago’s Division of Specialized Care for Children sponsors the conference and serves on its steering committee]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ayla Etheridge, who was born with a spinal lipoma and uses a wheelchair, is a careful planner who is extremely tech-savvy and loves gaming, character design and writing.</p>
<p>As she attended the Illinois Statewide Transition Conference recently, Etheridge, 16, thought more about how these interests and skills will shape her future and career goals.</p>
<p>“I’m very independent and would like to do more things myself,” Etheridge said. “This conference has kind of helped me visualize and think about my next steps.”</p>
<p>The 17th annual transition conference, titled “Stepping Stones of Transition,” took place in East Peoria Nov. 3-4. The conference helps families and professionals learn about the resources, information and opportunities available for youth with disabilities as they prepare for adulthood.</p>
<p>Etheridge and her mom, Rachel, were among nearly 450 people who attended in person.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago’s Division of Specialized Care for Children sponsors the conference and serves on its steering committee.</p>
<p>DSCC also covered the related costs for 34 participant family members to attend, including the Etheridges and the Barraza family.</p>
<p>“I am so thankful to DSCC for the fact they covered the cost to be here. That made a big difference in us being able to attend,” Anita Barraza said.</p>
<h3>“Education empowers me”</h3>
<p>Anita’s son, Daniel Barraza, 17, is a DSCC participant. His older sister, Diana Barraza, 22, left DSCC last summer.</p>
<p>Anita Barraza is an occupational therapist who works with schoolchildren, so she understands both sides of the need for information and resources when supporting young adults with disabilities.</p>
<p>“As a parent, we can feel so overwhelmed. Even if help is right there, that reach can be hard to do,” Anita Barraza said.</p>
<p>That’s why opportunities to learn about a variety of resources and network with other families and professionals are so important.</p>
<p>“These types of resources educate me on how to best provide for my children’s needs and for their future,” Anita Barraza said.</p>
<p>“Education empowers me to be better prepared to help (Diana and Daniel) have a good quality of life.&#8221;</p>
<h3>“One step ahead”</h3>
<p>Anita Barraza had told two other DSCC moms about the conference and encouraged them to attend. One is her friend, Yessy Castillo.</p>
<p>Though Castillo&#8217;s son, Jacob Ortiz, is only 4 years old, she knew it was important to go.</p>
<p>“I want to be aware of what services are available for Jacob,” Castillo said. “Most importantly, I want to be one step ahead. This conference allows me to get the information on what can benefit Jacob.”</p>
<p>Jacob was born with a cleft palate, an underdeveloped jaw and other body malformations, and depends on a ventilator 24-7 to breathe.</p>
<p>“I appreciate getting the opportunity to meet people and attorneys for advice and support and more legal information on Jacob’s rights,” she said. “If I was not exposed to these events, I wouldn’t know what is available.”</p>
<p>Conference attendee Melania Tinoco said connecting with other families helped her feel more confident.</p>
<p>“It helps seeing we’re all in the same boat and finding out we aren’t alone,” Tinoco said.</p>
<p>Her daughter, Jeny, is 14 and has been a DSCC participant since birth. Jeny has Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome, a rare genetic and neurological condition that causes developmental delays.</p>
<p>Tinoco said the conference has helped her plan for the future, and she appreciated the breakout sessions on helping youth with disabilities respect their body and feel empowered to say “no.”</p>
<p>“The information has been helpful and inspirational,” Tinoco said.</p>
<h3>Putting information into action</h3>
<p>The conference consisted of informative breakout sessions in the areas of employment, education, health care and more.</p>
<p>DSCC participant Vera Lynn Lindquist, 17, and her grandmother, Cheryl Lindquist Calcese, said they enjoyed the “Awareness and Transition Services for Students with Disabilities” session. It gave them helpful information on sex education and tips for building good money management skills.</p>
<p>They plan to start a budget system at home after the conference. Lindquist, who has autism and other disorders, will get paid for doing chores and get a debit card to purchase items and track spending.</p>
<p>DSCC participant Sabrina Doueihi, 20, was among several self-advocates who shared their perspectives during the “Transition Success Stories” breakout session. She is a junior at Bradley College, where she is studying criminology. She hopes to go to law school and become a prosecutor.</p>
<p>She spoke about the importance of staying true to yourself and what you want to do. She also recommended that youth with disabilities focus on what they can do and who can help them achieve their goals.</p>
<h3>“Trade stories and network”</h3>
<p>For brothers Jaysen and Justen McMenamin, and their parents, the transition conference was a good opportunity to plan for life after high school.</p>
<p>Jaysen McMenamin, 18, is a senior at Woodland High School near Streator, where he is an honor roll student and honorary captain of the school’s football team. He&#8217;s interested in digital media and related job opportunities. Justen McMenamin, 14, is a freshman at Woodland High and interested in coding. Both brothers have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and are enrolled with DSCC.</p>
<p>Their stepfather, Charles Cusick, said the family wanted to learn more about jobs and career fields that are accessible.</p>
<p>The brothers’ mom, Deanna Cox, said she appreciated the breakout session on Supplemental Security Income benefits. Jaysen and Justen’s dad passed away in June, and the session helped her better understand how to help her boys keep the benefits they’re entitled to.</p>
<p>The family met up with their DSCC Care Coordinator Kristin Lenover during the conference.</p>
<p>“If families can get away from work, there’s so much they will get out of being at the transition conference,” Lenover said. “Attending in person gives you so much access to all kinds of information. There are also opportunities to meet other families, trade stories and network.”</p>
<p>Thirty DSCC team members attended the conference to network, learn from others and strengthen their skillsets and tools to serve participant families.</p>
<p>DSCC also sponsored the conference’s health care track for providers who play a role in the transition from the pediatric to adult health care system and those who build youth’s capacity and health care skills to prepare for adulthood.</p>
<p>DSCC Transition Specialist Darcy Contri has helped plan the conference since it began 17 years ago. This year’s event was her last before she retires.</p>
<p>“I’m so grateful for and have loved being part of this great work,” Contri said. “Partnering with talented people from organizations across the state to help others has made a positive difference in so many lives. It is my hope the annual conference will continue to make an impact on improving adult outcomes for youth with disabilities for many more years.”</p>

<p>UIC sociologist Amy Bailey describes Christine “CC” Hier as “intellectually fearless, deeply committed to using her scholarship for social justice and exceptionally focused on her academic pursuits.”</p>
<p>Through her Honors College capstone project at UIC, Hier has deepened her dedication to social justice and pursuit of a career involving research that informs public policy on racial inequality. </p>
<p>In a class led by Bailey, associate professor of sociology and Hier’s Honors College Fellow, Hier coded archival documents related to lynchings that occurred in the southern United States. It served as the inspiration for her capstone project, which examines multigenerational trauma that connects the history of lynching in the U.S. with ongoing murders by police.</p>
<p>Diligently working on such an intense and personal subject for the past 18 months has been fulfilling and moving — but most importantly necessary, according to Hier.</p>
<p>“It’s very prudent for where we are as a society today. In my research, I don&#8217;t just look at historical lynchings that we are ‘familiar’ with in terms of their historical context, but I bring that into the modern day and define modern-day lynchings under police murders and focus on the lack of due process,” she said. “I love that this project solidifies what I love to do, and I know that this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>After she graduates with a bachelor’s degree in sociology Dec. 10 from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Hier wants to continue inequality research and is currently exploring international graduate school opportunities at Sciences Po in Paris, Oxford and Cambridge. She hopes to eventually hold a management role with a nonprofit, such as Black Lives Matter, that allows her to work on research to help inform public policies.</p>
<p>“Lynching was just signed into law as a federal hate crime this year so I think that says a lot about how far we still have to go with protecting Black and brown lives. This is absolutely what I want to do and what I&#8217;m extremely passionate about,” she said.</p>
<p>Hier looks back at her time at UIC as a “wonderful experience,” particularly developing important connections and interpersonal relationships with students and professors alike.</p>
<p>“I love being super-involved with professors in my classes, and with other students in collaborative work,” she said. “My last couple years have just been wonderful being able to be on campus, interact and knock on doors and just say, ‘Hey, do you have a minute?’”</p>
<p>”Her genuine excitement about learning and ideas, even communicated over Zoom during the depths of the pandemic, was infectious,” Bailey said.</p>
<p>She is a member of the French and Sociology clubs at UIC and was the only sociologist in the first cohort of UIC’s <a href="https://surf.econ.uic.edu/">Social insurance Undergraduate Research Fellowship</a>, a competitive program that provides promising undergraduate students with an introduction to the policies surrounding the social safety net and opportunities for research investigating these programs, and their impact on economically vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>During and after high school, the native of Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood dealt with family and mental health matters that delayed her college career. She worked for 10 years in high-end retail businesses and restaurants.</p>
<p>“I just realized that my questioning spirit wasn&#8217;t a good fit for most jobs,” she said. “My struggle with depression and anxiety is ongoing, but since finding purpose and reason within academia, I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.”</p>
<p>Hier eventually applied that inquisitive nature during two years of study at Harold Washington College, which served as her springboard to UIC. There she was drawn to research and a potential career in sociology through the mentorship of professor and UIC alumnus Juan Martinez.</p>
<p>“Taking the first sociology classes just really ignited what I now know as sociological imagination, and it solidified those parts of my personality that I knew were always going to end up in sociology one way or another,” she said. “As a Black woman, I wanted to be able to influence Black research within sociology. We&#8217;re few and far between in the field, and being able to research racial inequality in Black spaces was really important to me.”</p>
<p>For Hier, who wondered if she would ever experience this moment, reflecting on the path to commencement is an emotional and proud moment.</p>
<p>“It was very freeing being able to pursue something that I&#8217;ve always been very passionate about, and in a capacity that I&#8217;m able to perform at my highest level,” she said. “I would hope that if anybody is struggling with their mental health or not being seen or heard, that they can kind of look at this and say, ‘OK, if I just go one more day, maybe it&#8217;ll get better.’”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A citizen of the Lac Du Flambeau Nation of Wisconsin, Erica Bhatti aims to provide her fellow citizens with medical care]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p>As a citizen of the Lac du Flambeau Tribe of Wisconsin, Erica Bhatti’s dream has been to return to her reservation as a doctor and give back by providing her fellow citizens with proper medical care.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/erica-bhatti_v/"><img loading="lazy" width="271" height="406" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erica-Bhatti_v-271x406.jpg" alt="Erica Bhatti" class="wp-image-139205" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erica-Bhatti_v-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erica-Bhatti_v-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erica-Bhatti_v-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erica-Bhatti_v-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erica-Bhatti_v-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erica-Bhatti_v-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erica-Bhatti_v-1000x1499.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erica-Bhatti_v-1320x1979.jpg 1320w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Erica-Bhatti_v.jpg 1496w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a><figcaption>Erica Bhatti is graduating on Dec. 10. Photo provided.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The University of Illinois Chicago student will be one step closer to achieving this goal when she graduates from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Dec. 10 with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in neuroscience. Bhatti plans to continue her studies in medical school.</p>



<p>She described the reservation, which is more than 350 miles north of Chicago in northern Wisconsin, as a quaint community of about 2,000 people, where her mother’s side of the family lives as citizens. As a child, she lived with her parents in Paris, France, before relocating with her mother and siblings to the reservation.</p>



<p>“I grew up outside in the Northwoods, learning how to fish and gather medicines; it’s a very beautiful and traditional way of life up there,” Bhatti said.</p>



<p>After attending a local community college near her home in Wisconsin her freshman year, she realized that she needed more research opportunities and looked at Chicago and UIC as places that could offer her more to achieve her dreams. What drew her to UIC was its focus on research, which would go along with her focus as a pre-medicine student.</p>



<p>During a visit to campus before her sophomore year, she was pleasantly surprised to discover that UIC had an active <a href="https://nasp.uic.edu/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nasp.uic.edu/">Native American Support Program</a>. She then learned that since 2019 the university has been <a href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-to-offer-in-state-tuition-to-students-from-any-of-the-573-tribal-nations-in-us/">offering in-state tuition</a> to students who are members of any of the 573 tribal nations recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p>



<p>“I chose to go to UIC because it leads in research, and I knew I wanted to be in pre-medicine so that was the big reason why I came and toured the campus,” Bhatti said. “Then I saw that there was a recognized Native American Support Program, and in-state tuition and that was the cherry on top. That program has saved me thousands of dollars.”</p>



<p>For her research she became involved in the <a href="https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/departments/academic-departments/pediatrics/research/path-2-purpose/">Path 2 Purpose</a> study, which is a free, voluntary program for teenagers who want to improve their mood and learn coping skills to manage difficult situations. Pioneered by leading universities including UIC, the study is a clinical trial that will determine how best to help teens build healthy lifestyles.</p>



<p>“I just really enjoyed the interaction I had with teens. I was able to have research experience under my belt. so that has been really helpful,” she said.</p>



<p>Bhatti, who is president of the Native American and Indigenous Students Organization, credited the Native American Support Program for extending its reach off campus to the American Indian Center of Chicago, with whom it holds close ties. She said this allowed her to be exposed to more of what Chicago had to offer in regard to Indigenous issues. The Native American Support Program also connected her with the American Indian Health Service of Chicago, which she expects will be a resource as an Indigenous physician in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;As president of NAISO, I planned events, collaborated with other student organizations, connected with my peers, and assisted&nbsp;in planning the annual&nbsp;UIC Powwow,&#8221; Bhatti said. &#8220;Obtaining this title was very exciting and important for me as I have learned some important&nbsp;life skills like leadership and outreach. I was very proud to represent Indigenous students at UIC.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She said she plans to take a gap year to study for the medical school entrance exam and gain more experience with patients by working in a hospital or getting certified to work on an ambulance. She would like to get a dual degree that would allow her to earn her medical degree as well as a master’s in public health.</p>



<p>“UIC has guided me tremendously in terms of what I want for my future,” Bhatti said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Latrice Yates found the support she needed to thrive on campus from UIC’s Student Success Units]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/image-9/"><img loading="lazy" width="386" height="258" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image-386x258.jpg" alt="Latrice Yates" class="wp-image-139204" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image-386x258.jpg 386w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image-590x394.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image-500x334.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Image.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px" /></a><figcaption>Latrice Yates</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>During her first few weeks at UIC, Latrice Yates found the support she needed to thrive on campus from UIC’s <a href="https://vpuaap.uic.edu/offices-and-programs/success-units/">Student Success Units</a>, so she made it her mission to pay it forward by dedicating her time to helping others leave their mark on campus and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>“I loved every single moment at UIC, and I’m very grateful for all the opportunities that came my way,” said Yates, who graduates Dec. 10 from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences with a bachelor’s degree in applied psychology.</p>
<p>Yates grew up in Rockford, then moved to Carrollton, Texas, with her family in high school, but she set her sights on returning to Illinois for college.</p>
<p>“I missed Chicago a lot, and I wanted to do whatever it took to come back,” said Yates, who also is a member of the Honors College.</p>
<p>When she arrived on campus in the fall of 2019, Yates attended the <a href="https://aaan.uic.edu/">African American Academic Network</a>’s annual Black 2 School BBQ and met new friends and staff members, including Jeff Brown, AAAN director.</p>
<p>“AAAN was a resource for me from day one,” Yates said. “When I told Jeff Brown I was looking for a job, he actually went and introduced me to the different offices in SSB, and he helped me find my first job.”</p>
<p>“From his grace, I was able to find a lot of different opportunities, and I was able to feel more comfortable asking for help. Everybody in AAAN is willing to help. Their commitment to getting involved with the success of students early is a huge reason I was able to find the skills and opportunities to get involved.”</p>
<p>During her first semester, Yates also was looking for a writing tutor, so she reached out to the <a href="https://ace.uic.edu/">Academic Center for Excellence</a> for help.</p>
<p>“ACE helped me by being a resource for all of the questions I had,” Yates said. “There were so many resources and organizations on campus, and I just didn’t know where to begin. They made it less complicated.”</p>
<p>Because these support units had set Yates up for success, she wanted to get involved with them and give back. She dedicated her time to becoming a peer success coach for ACE and a peer tutor for AAAN.</p>
<p>For AAAN, she assists students with their English and Spanish coursework.</p>
<p>“When we first start our tutoring sessions, I always ask how they&#8217;re doing, and we have a conversation about the things that they&#8217;re going through,” Yates said. “So even though the primary function is for academics, it&#8217;s also a support network to make sure that they’re doing OK mentally and emotionally as well.”</p>
<p>As a peer success coach with ACE, Yates mentors first-year and transfer students, providing outreach and education about campus resources, deadlines to remember, ways to get involved and more. She also hosts office hours so students can drop in to talk about their career goals, academic timelines or just find support from a familiar face.</p>
<p>“I love being a resource one can rely on because I think everyone should know all UIC has to offer,” she said.</p>
<p>The psychology department and AAAN also helped connect Yates with the <a href="https://grad.uic.edu/diversity/srop-program/">Summer Research Opportunities Program</a>, where she assisted UIC faculty members Geri Donenberg and Natasha Crooks in creating a program to encourage Black fathers to talk with their daughters, ages 13 to 18, about sexually transmitted infections.</p>
<p>“In the Black community, the father doesn&#8217;t think that it’s their role to have those conversations,” Yates said. “But really, we believe that they&#8217;re actually essential to having those conversations. We try to teach communication methods and make sure that they have those healthy relationships so that the daughter could, in turn, go to them for questions that they have about sexual health because they&#8217;re the best person to get it from, compared to going to their friends, who might not have the most accurate information.”</p>
<p>Her work with AAAN and the summer research program helped Yates determine the focus for her future research.</p>
<p>“UIC has prepared me for a future in psychology, and I&#8217;m very grateful for all the opportunities that allowed me to explore and see what was for me,” she said. “Working with an all-Black staff and an all-Black population has been my confirmation that I want to continue to cater to this population, but with emphasis on the mental health disparities.”</p>
<p>Yates is now applying to doctoral programs with the goal of becoming a clinical psychologist.</p>
<p>“I want to focus on Black girls specifically and implement mental health programs for this demographic because I feel like in that community, mental health doesn’t really get addressed,” Yates said. “I think it gets overlooked and I want to offer that support.”</p>

<p>Two University of Illinois Chicago engineering students were recently named ComEd Scholars and will be provided scholarships to fill the tuition gap not covered by financial aid.</p>



<p>The students, Chanel Hamilton and Aaron Tillery, make up the 2022 ComEd Scholars fourth cohort and are part of the UIC CHANCE program’s <a href="https://chance.uic.edu/community-outreach/pre-college-programs/summer-camp-stem-academy/">STEM Academy</a>.</p>



<p>Tillery is a second-year student from Chicago’s Washington Heights neighborhood who is pursuing a degree in computer engineering, and Hamilton is a first-year student from suburban Country Club Hills who is pursuing an engineering degree.</p>



<p>Tillery said he was extremely grateful and honored to be one of ComEd’s new scholarship recipients. He said he was thankful for &#8220;all of the amazing leaders and staff&#8221; at UIC, CHANCE and ComEd.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since entering college, I have been able to work harder and get one step closer to my dream of becoming a computer engineer. Being able to build technology for the future and help my city is something that I strive to achieve,&#8221; Tillery said. &#8220;With the help of ComEd and the CHANCE program, I am on the path to doing so. I am blessed and excited about what the future holds.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a new college student and as a first-generation student, Hamilton said she appreciated the help and financial support that CHANCE and ComEd have offered her. The support began for her when she was involved in the program’s summer engineering class.</p>

<p>“Not only did I learn how to do some of the more difficult aspects of engineering as an aspiring engineer, but I also learned about the open and inclusive environment at UIC,” Hamilton said. “I was extremely excited to apply to UIC when I heard about this incredible opportunity with ComEd because I admire the work that ComEd has done for the community. I will make CHANCE and ComEd proud.” </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.comed.com/SafetyCommunity/Education/Pages/ForCollegeStudents.aspx">ComEd Scholars program</a> aims to invest in a diverse workforce, ComEd officials said. In addition to the UIC students, two students from the Illinois Institute of Technology, also known as Illinois Tech, also were recipients.</p>



<p>The ComEd Scholars program, in its fourth year, provides scholarships to students pursuing degrees in STEM that cover education-related costs that exceed financial aid. Since the ComEd Scholars Program&#8217;s inception in 2019, 26 students have been awarded support.</p>



<p>“ComEd’s commitment to creating the diverse STEM workforce of the future exemplifies what it means to create equitable pathways for the next generation of leaders and change-makers,” said UIC Interim Chancellor Javier Reyes. “We are thankful for this partnership and investment in UIC students.”</p>



<p>ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones said the scholarships represent “an investment in your academic and professional journey.” He said the company aims to provide students with exposure through its internships and assistance to become STEM leaders.</p>



<p>In addition to financial assistance, the ComEd Scholars are also granted the opportunity to interview for internships at ComEd and its parent company, Exelon, and are encouraged to participate in a mentorship program with ComEd engineers.</p>



<p>“At ComEd we are committed to diversifying the STEM workforce and supporting talented students from across our communities,” Quiniones said. “The ComEd Scholars program seeks to give students knowledge, confidence and resources to not only achieve their education and career aspirations, but to also have a meaningful impact in their communities for years to come.”</p>



<p>UIC’s <a href="https://chance.uic.edu/">CHANCE program</a> began in 2004 and was designed to assist the university with its goal to increase recruitment, retention and graduation rates of underrepresented students in partnership with Chicago Public Schools, City Colleges of Chicago, community-based organizations, various suburban school districts and charter schools. CHANCE stands for Counseling Help and Assistance Necessary for a 21st Century College Education.</p>



<p>&#8220;This partnership continues to enhance the lives of our scholars. The CHANCE Program is delighted to work with ComEd,” CHANCE Director Khalilah Young said. “This opportunity is life-altering; we are so grateful to ComEd for investing in the brilliant minds here at UIC.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[New research from the Jane Addams College of Social Work]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Researchers at the Jane Addams College of Social Work, led by associate professor Otima Doyle, have published a study in the Journal of Child and Family Studies on how African American fathers envision prevention programs aimed at supporting African American male youths who are at-risk for developing depression and/or aggressive behaviors. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The journal’s editors recently selected the paper, titled “</span><a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10826/updates/19243374"><span data-contrast="none">All About How You Couch It:” African American Fathers’ Visions of Interventions for their Sons</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">” as an ‘Editors’ Choice’ article based on its scientific quality and public health relevance. The paper is available free to the public until Nov. 30.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Studies focusing on the behavioral health needs of young African American boys, as well as the strengths, contributions, and challenges faced by fathers (especially men living away from the child and are low-income) have been increasing. There remains, however, much to be learned, Doyle said. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Her latest work, which was assisted by colleagues Branden McLeod, PhD, associate professor at the Jane Addams College of Social Work, and Qiana R. Cryer-Coupet, PhD, associate professor of social work at Georgia State University who received her doctorate degree from the JACSW in 2015, is one of several related papers completed from this dataset. The related papers emphasize African American fathers’ co-parenting experiences, parenting practices, values they have passed down to their sons, and recruitment of fathers into clinically relevant programs. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Doyle’s research centers on how a father-focused approach to programming can prevent the onset of depression and aggression among African American youth who are at-risk. African American fathers are often involved in their children’s lives, even when they do not live with their children, and when they are no longer romantically involved with their children’s mother(s). Numerous fatherhood interventions have been developed, such as those included in the Responsible Fatherhood Programs, yet Doyle and her colleagues believe that “it is important to look deeper into the lived experiences of African American fathers,” she said. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many African American youth are exposed to risk factors that can lead to the development of aggressive behaviors and depressive symptoms, such as lack of neighborhood safety, poverty, and racism. Moreover, “African Americans’ experiences with mood disorders, such as depression, may be particularly chronic and burdensome, and they are less likely than their White peers to receive care,” Doyle said. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Those who receive treatment may be misdiagnosed due to nuanced clinical presentations of depression, which, on the surface, might look like anger, aggression or irritability,” she said. “Such misdiagnoses increase the risk of suicide, which rose by 60% between 2001 and 2017 among African American adolescent males.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A notable contribution of the study is the first-hand accounts of the African American fathers who reported being active in their sons’ lives. Doyle conducted extensive interviews with 30 African American fathers whose biological sons, ranging in age from eight to 12, were at individual-, family-, or community-level risk for developing aggressive behaviors and/or depressive symptoms. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Numerous themes emerged from Doyle’s research. In those refrains fathers candidly expressed ideas about what could be useful in terms of the program content, as well as how such a program might be structured to best meet the needs of – and be of interest to – African American fathers and their sons. Fathers emphasized the importance of a strength-based approach that honors their lived realities. They endorsed group-based interventions characterized by a safe space, bonding opportunities with fathers and sons, and hands-on activities. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Fathers were interested in learning from their peers about parenting, but felt opportunities were limited to do so in a safe space where they could talk candidly about their experiences, including fears, worries, challenges and triumphs.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Bonding across families can also be beneficial.</span><span data-contrast="none"> Stated one father, “If you know that your son’s having an issue with this, have him talk to somebody else that can give him a different insight, different view. ‘Cause a lot of times we will receive things from somebody else before we receive it from our own parents directly.” </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The study’s findings, Doyle said, have direct implications for father-focused interventions. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">“They highlight the importance of creating safe spaces for African American fathers to interact with each other and their sons, as well as the need to incorporate – or center – kinesthetic activities,&#8221; Doyle said.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Support student success, faculty innovation and more with a gift on GivingTuesday Nov. 29]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>UIC students and faculty change the world by discovering cures, connecting communities, demanding justice and more. Make a gift on GivingTuesday Nov. 29 to empower their work.</p>
<p>“One of the things that is most common among UIC faculty and staff is our collective dedication to UIC’s mission. GivingTuesday is a moment in the year for each of us to pause and demonstrate our commitment to it in a way that works for us,” said Tom Wamsley, vice chancellor for advancement. “Together, our contributions as a community drive the transformational work that happens at UIC every day.”</p>
<p>Since 2013, UIC has engaged in GivingTuesday, a global movement that inspires people to give, collaborate and celebrate generosity.</p>
<p>Participate in GivingTuesday by <a href="https://givingtuesday.uic.edu/">donating online</a> now through Dec. 2. Donors can select which college or unit they would like to support, as well as choose funds that immediately impact student scholarships, faculty initiatives, community engagement, social justice initiatives and more.</p>
<p>During a record-shattering GivingTuesday initiative in 2021, donors to UIC contributed $1,032,838 toward supporting students, faculty initiatives, community engagement and research. The 2021 GivingTuesday initiative saw a 15% increase in the number of donors, with 1,828 alumni, friends, faculty, staff, students and parents contributing gifts in support of UIC.   </p>
<p>This year’s goal is to reach 2,000 donors.</p>
<p>“Every UIC employee, every day, is contributing to UIC. GivingTuesday, however, is a true demonstration of the power of collective giving,” Wamsley said. “Last year the vast majority of GivingTuesday gifts were under $250. Yet total contributions topped $1 million. Every single contribution, no matter the size, immediately goes to fueling work that answers UIC’s mission.”</p>
<p>Students are also encouraged to post a message on social media about how they want to change the world using the hashtags #UICtogether and #GivingTuesday. Students and other supporters can access images and <a href="https://go.uic.edu/champion">sample posts online</a>.</p>
<p>“Students and their families can give as well if they’re able. But their advocacy and championing UIC is just as important,” Wamsley said. “They can support the cause by posting on social media why they are proud to be part of UIC.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UIC Associate Professor Rachel Poretsky, from the UIC Department of Biological Sciences in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, accepted a Chicago Innovation Award Nov. 16 on behalf of a collaborative, multi-institution team effort to monitor the ebb and flow of COVID-19 in Chicago and Illinois by detecting the virus&#8217;s presence in wastewater.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team was assembled by Discovery Partners Institute — the organization that received the award —  and was one of the first teams in the nation to reliably analyze samples of raw sewage for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 2021, providing real-time information to help both the Chicago Department of Public Health and the Illinois Department of Public Health during the pandemic.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Illinois Wastewater Surveillance System is a collaboration between the IDPH and the DPI-led team which, in addition to UIC, includes Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory. Under a separate contract, DPI and those same partners provide similar services for CDPH.</span></p>



<p>Poretsky&#8217;s team at UIC includes Jarju Modou, visiting lab technician; Chi-Yu Lin, visiting research scholar;  Dolores Sanchez, visiting lab manager; Adam Horton, lab manager; and UIC graduate students Leah Kelly and Christopher Owen. </p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are proud to be recognized by the Chicago Innovation judges after less than three years of DPI really getting off the ground,” DPI Executive Director Bill Jackson said. “Our success in wastewater surveillance shows the promise of our mission, which is to bring together the best minds in greater Chicago and beyond to solve some of the toughest problems facing society.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This honor belongs to our entire team,” said Laura Clements, DPI’s senior project manager for R&amp;D. “Each one is crucial to the success of this undertaking — we literally couldn’t have accomplished this without them.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is excreted in the feces and urine of infected people even if they have no symptoms. Suspended in raw sewage, these telltales eventually make their way into wastewater treatment facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 75 wastewater treatment plants in metro Chicago and elsewhere in Illinois voluntarily submit sewage samples to the DPI team twice weekly. These are analyzed at a high-throughput lab built by UIC and then sent to Argonne for genetic sequencing to identify variants.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Chicago, samples are also drawn directly from specific neighborhood sewers to get a more localized picture of COVID-19 trends, and at O’Hare International Airport to spot new variants that travelers might be bringing into the area.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results are shared with public health decision-makers, wastewater plant operators and the public through a variety of mechanisms, including online dashboards.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, the network has expanded to more than 80 monitoring sites measuring the exposure of more than 8 million people in Illinois to COVID-19, or more than two-thirds of the state’s population. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DPI and Shield T3, a for-profit startup spun out of University of Illinois, are also conducting a </span><a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/resource-center/news/2022/september/idph-and-university-of-illinois-spinoff-launch-wastewater-testin.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pilot program to test wastewater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the coronavirus at public schools.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawing from these experiences, DPI additionally is partnering with UIC and Rush University Medical Center to collect and analyze wastewater to identify the presence of </span><a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/rush-discovery-partners-institute-awarded-cdc-contract-to-test-wastewater-for-antibiotic-resistant-organisms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially deadly antibiotic-resistant organisms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in long-term care facilities. And the DPI team recently began screening sewage samples for influenza A and B for the state.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Innovation’s mission is to empower the Chicago Innovation Ecosystem by educating, connecting and celebrating innovators. The Chicago Innovation Awards began in 2002. The more than 350 previous winners cut across all industries, representing big companies, small companies, for-profit and not-for-profit, high-tech, low-tech and no-tech. They demonstrate the breadth of innovation that is unique to the Chicago region.</span></p>

<p>Elizabeth McMath has joined the <a href="https://chicagobiomedicalconsortium.org/">Chicago Biomedical Consortium</a>, a research and education collaboration of the University of Illinois Chicago, Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, as the senior director of new program innovation and entrepreneurship. </p>



<p>McMath brings extensive experience in the evaluation of new therapies and biomedical innovation, most recently as director of global search and evaluation at Novartis. There, she built the deal pipeline for clinical stage programs addressing severe genetic diseases including innovative gene therapies as part of the former AveXis, now Novartis Gene Therapies business unit.</p>



<p>Bringing industry perspectives and rigorous evaluation methodologies, McMath will be responsible for driving the CBC’s analysis of cutting-edge biomedical applications sourced from member universities.&nbsp;Critical to these analyses is the <a href="https://chicagobiomedicalconsortium.org/awards/entrepreneurial-fellows/">Entrepreneurial Fellows</a> Award program, a signature CBC program that McMath will oversee and which was developed in partnership with <a href="https://p33chicago.com/">P33</a>, a privately funded nonprofit charged with elevating Chicagoland’s innovation economy and driving inclusive economic growth.</p>



<p>“Chicago’s life sciences ecosystem is poised to grow rapidly, and the expertise housed at the CBC will be integral. As a partner to CBC’s mission to inclusively grow Chicago’s life sciences ecosystem, we are excited for Dr. McMath to lead the Entrepreneurial Fellows program and help fund some of our best potential applications. Applying industry frameworks to early science commercialization and working with our great scientists will help ensure that the region retains the value of our world class research,” said Brad Henderson, CEO of P33.</p>



<p>The CBC helps commercialize university life sciences projects with $250,000 Accelerator Awards that help traverse the biotech “Valley of Death” between government and venture capital funding.&nbsp;To pick the most promising university projects, the CBC’s Entrepreneurial Fellows, supervised by McMath, perform industry grade due diligence, and confirm funding recommendations with a volunteer board of venture capitalists from 14 different Life Sciences funds. With McMath’s guidance and VC feedback, EFs learn to evaluate academic projects from an industry perspective, a critical skill in Chicagoland’s growing life sciences sector.</p>



<p>The EF program seeks to <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/chicago-innovators-a-four-person-cohort-may-seed-the-biotech-industry-in-chicago/5b1f2fb8-999f-4b66-b66a-d5e2cf948b5f">retain some of the best early career, biomedical research science talent</a> — a diverse group of MDs, PhDs, PharmDs — to work in Chicago’s biotech sector. Fellows receive a generous salary and benefits as they learn on-the-job to evaluate the potential of academic projects to translate to society and US Healthcare markets. After their fellowship, fellows have pledged to work in the Chicagoland ecosystem, building Chicagoland’s life sciences capabilities. By building an inclusive program, P33 and CBC intend to seed the Chicago life sciences ecosystem with diverse life sciences talent.        </p>



<p>Prior to Novartis, McMath advised life sciences companies on commercialization and growth strategy at <a href="http://www.biostrategies.com/index.php">bioStrategies</a> Group, a Chicago-based, boutique consulting firm.&nbsp;McMath received a doctoral degree in genetics from the University of Wisconsin and completed her undergraduate studies at Northwestern University.</p>



<p>Launched in 2006, the CBC is funded by the Searle Funds at the Chicago Community Trust and represents an unprecedented collaboration across three universities each of which is its own biomedical colossus: the University of Illinois Chicago, Northwestern University and the University of Chicago &nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[UIC COVID-19 Contact Tracing and Epidemiology Program helped reduce exposures, infections on campus]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://publichealth.uic.edu/uic-covid-19-public-health-response/uic-covid-19-contact-tracing-and-epidemiology-program/">UIC COVID-19 Contact Tracing and Epidemiology Program</a> — a novel, student-driven program — helped reduce COVID-19 exposures and infections on campus during the 2020-21 academic year, according to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2022.09.025">results published today</a> in the American Journal of Infection Control<em>.</em></p>
<p>The program, which deployed UIC students to conduct COVID-19 case investigations and contact tracing among nonclinical UIC community members, proved to be a highly effective pandemic-response effort in a university setting, the results show. </p>
<p>“Although population-based contact-tracing approaches to help control COVID-19 transmission in U.S. cities have faced significant challenges, our findings suggest that universities are a unique setting where it can be highly effective, particularly when there is strong institutional buy-in for public health interventions,” said Jocelyn Vaughn, research data scientist in the School of Public Health and one of the paper’s lead authors. “Universities should consider utilizing students in COVID-19 and other infectious disease response efforts.”</p>
<p>In August 2020, Vaughn and colleagues created UIC&#8217;s contact tracing program, which was staffed by a fully remote workforce of public health practitioners and trained students. The program was approved by the Chicago Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>“We trained students to conduct both case investigations and contact tracing, which contrasted with the approach taken by most Illinois health departments, but provided both flexibility and cost-effectiveness advantages that contributed to our program’s success,” Vaughn said. “Routine data translation and dissemination, as well as the partnerships we established with CDPH and departments across the university, were also essential.”</p>
<p>Using REDCap, a HIPAA-compliant data-capture and reporting system hosted at UIC, contact tracers interviewed nonclinical students and employees who tested positive for COVID-19 on campus or self-reported their results. Their goal was to reach all cases and contacts within 48 hours of specimen collection or exposure notification.</p>
<p>From Aug. 31, 2020, to May 22, 2021, UIC contact tracers served 1,009 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 746 contacts. Contact tracers reached 96% of cases in about one day from specimen collection, effectively quarantining 120 cases, preventing an estimated 132 downstream exposures and 22 COVID-19 infections. Among 18 identified clusters, contact tracers were able to more than 100 infections, the data shows.</p>
<p>“This program provides exciting evidence that nonclinical university students can be efficiently engaged to provide rapid, thorough and cost-effective investigation and contact tracing to supplement local public health departments’ pandemic response efforts,” said Linda Dickey, president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago has been named to <a href="https://allinchallenge.org/">ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge</a>’s inaugural <a href="https://allinchallenge.org/most-engaged-campuses/">ALL IN Most Engaged Campuses for College Student Voting</a> recognition program. This program recognizes participating institutions that worked to increase nonpartisan student voter registration, education and turnout and ensure equitable access to the polls for their campus community.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/a-message-to-campus-about-election-day/20201027_vote_180/"><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="393" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201027_VOTE_180-590x393.jpg" alt="Voters at UIC" class="wp-image-102980" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201027_VOTE_180-590x393.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201027_VOTE_180-387x258.jpg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201027_VOTE_180-768x512.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201027_VOTE_180-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201027_VOTE_180-500x333.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201027_VOTE_180-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201027_VOTE_180.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>UIC joins a group of 394 colleges and universities acknowledged by ALL IN for meeting four core requirements:</p>



<ul><li>Participated in the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge.</li><li>Shared a 2020 National Study of Learning Voting and Engagement Report with campus voting data with ALL IN.</li><li>Developed and submitted a 2022 democratic engagement action plan with ALL IN.</li><li>Have a current signatory to ALL IN’s Higher Education Presidents’ Commitment to Full Student Voter Participation.</li></ul>



<p>UIC also earned ALL IN’s Highly Established Action Plan Seal of recognition, which identifies higher education institutions with strong action plans to increase nonpartisan democratic engagement by promoting civic learning, political engagement and college student voter participation. Action plan strength is determined by reviewing campus action plans with the Strengthening American Democracy Action Planning Rubric.</p>



<p>Among UIC&#8217;s various efforts are annual events, such as Constitution Day, National Voter Registration Day, the National Student Issues Convention and the Future of Chicago Speaker Series, which afford students, staff and faculty the opportunity for democratic engagement throughout the year.</p>



<p>UIC serves as a City of Chicago voting site, and thousands of students cast their ballots on campus each election cycle. Before the Nov. 8 election, UIC transitioned from being a university early voting site with three days of voting to be the primary early voting site for Chicago’s 34th Ward.</p>



<p>Among units at UIC that lead the university’s civic engagement efforts are UIC Government Relations and Advocacy, the UIC Alumni Association, Student Leadership and Civic Engagement, and the Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement.</p>



<p>“The research is clear: colleges and universities that make intentional efforts to increase nonpartisan democratic engagement have higher campus voter registration and voter turnout rates. Despite ongoing obstacles, these campuses have remained dedicated in their commitment to ensuring that their students are informed and confident voters,” said Jennifer Domagal-Goldman, executive director of the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge.</p>



<p>Last year, UIC earned its third Voter Friendly Campus designation from the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, the national organization of student affairs administrators in higher education, and the Fair Elections Center’s Campus Vote Project. In 2020, Washington Monthly magazine named UIC one of the nation’s best universities for student voting. </p>



<p>The ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge, a national nonpartisan initiative of the nonprofit Civic Nation, currently engages over 9 million students from more than 950 institutions in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

A two-point increase over last year&#8217;s record of 91%, it marks the seventh consecutive year that UIC has raised its student-athlete graduation rate (from 82% in 2016 to 93% this year).<br /> <br />&#8220;Academic achievement is a point of pride for UIC student-athletes, who are as competitive in the classroom as they are in competition,&#8221; Director of Athletics Michael Lipitz said. &#8220;Their collective academic success in recent years is truly remarkable. Special thanks to our faculty, coaches and academic services staff for their collective support.&#8221;<br /> <br />Eight Flames teams posted perfect 100% graduation rates: volleyball, men&#8217;s tennis, women&#8217;s tennis, women&#8217;s soccer, women&#8217;s golf, women&#8217;s cross country and track and field, women&#8217;s basketball, and women&#8217;s swimming and diving. For volleyball, this marks 12 consecutive years graduating 100% of its student-athletes. Women&#8217;s soccer, women&#8217;s swimming and diving, and women&#8217;s tennis each notched perfect results for the fourth straight year.<br /> <br />UIC softball and men&#8217;s swimming and diving also posted strong graduation rates, with both programs recording a 94% graduation rate.<br /> <br />This fall&#8217;s graduation rate announcement follows a spring semester in which UIC student-athletes combined to record a 3.27 GPA, the 16th consecutive semester above a 3.0 for the Flames. One-third of UIC&#8217;s 300 student-athletes earned Dean&#8217;s List honors with GPAs of 3.5 or higher, while 66 recorded perfect 4.0 GPAs. The Flames tennis programs burned brightest in the classroom last spring, with the men&#8217;s squad earning a 3.64 GPA and the women&#8217;s squad leading all UIC teams with a 3.88 GPA.<br /> <br />&#8220;These incredible GSR numbers are a direct result of the continued dedication and commitment of our student-athletes, coaches, administration, and the entire UIC campus community,&#8221; said Karen Dixon, associate athletics director for academic services. &#8220;I am tremendously proud of our Flames student-athletes and the championship mindset they bring to their academic pursuits every day.&#8221;<br /> </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Researchers trace the movement of obsidian artifacts across the Andes ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A University of Illinois Chicago archeologist and colleagues used an &#8220;X-ray gun&#8221; to examine ancient obsidian artifacts from Peru, and in a newly published article, they report on the region’s cultural interactions and systems of exchange.  </p>

<p>In a paper in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X22003649">Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</a>, David Reid and colleagues detail how they used portable X-ray fluorescence to trace the movement of obsidian artifacts across the Andes to the Middle Moquegua Valley during the Middle Horizon period over 1,000 years ago.</p>



<p>A total of 50 obsidian artifacts housed in the Museo Contisuyu in Moquegua, Peru, were analyzed from 10 archaeological sites affiliated with Tiwanaku, Wari and indigenous Huaracane groups across the Formative Period and Middle Horizon eras (C.E. 600-1000).</p>



<p>Notably, their analysis finds obsidian tools and materials crossed social boundaries between the expansive Tiwanaku and Wari states along their only known shared frontier in Moquegua.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This study demonstrates that even when state colonists maintain strict cultural identities tied to homeland regions, such rigid social boundaries are rarely impermeable, and social networks may cross-cut traditional divisions,” said Reid, UIC postdoctoral research associate in anthropology.</p>



<p>Over half of the obsidians utilized by Tiwanaku were found to correspond with Wari-affiliated sources.</p>



<p>The exchange between expansionary states likely occurred due to sociopolitical factors, according to the researchers, who also note that further investigation is needed to determine whether this exchange was through peaceful trade and social interaction, scavenging, plunder or even literal “exchanges” of arrows in volleys.</p>



<p>Co-authors of the study are Paul Goldstein of the University of California, San Diego, and Patrick Ryan Williams of UIC and the Field Museum of Natural History.</p>



<p>This work was supported by funding obtained by Goldstein from the Fulbright-Hays, Wenner Gren, HJ Heinz III foundations and National Science Foundation awards (9809720 and 1067986). Assistance was also received via the Elemental Analysis Facility at the Field Museum, which has been funded by the W. W. Grainger Foundation, the Negaunee Foundation and the National Science Foundation (BCS-1628026, 1531394, 1321731, 0818401, and 0320903).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The UIC Department of Pharmacology and Regenerative Medicine in the [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UIC Department of Pharmacology and Regenerative Medicine in the College of Medicine first awarded a Program Project Grant from National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health in March 2000.</p>
<p>Since then, the department has been continuously home to two Program Project Grants. These multi-investigator current projects totaling over $22,000,000 center on &#8220;Macrophage Plasticity in Inflammatory Lung Injury&#8221; (program director Asrar B. Malik) and &#8220;The Lung Endothelium as an Instructive Niche for the Innate Immune System during vascular Injury&#8221; (program director Dolly Mehta). These current P01s, as well as additional long-term funding from NIH, DOD and NSF, contribute to the department’s status as one of the top-funded departments at UIC and pharmacology departments nationwide.</p>
<p>P01 awards are unique, as they “support broad multidisciplinary, long-term research programs involving groups of investigators working on research projects that contribute to the overall program objectives.” These grants have spurred numerous research collaborations both within the department and the university as a whole, as well as with other institutions, leading to transformative research projects and contributions.</p>
<p>In addition, seven multi-PI R01s and R33s were recently funded, indicating the intense level of collaborations within the Department.  A snapshot of these projects include &#8220;Programming of PMN host-defense function during transendothelial migration,&#8221; &#8220;Optogenetic control of tumor Initiation and tumor progression in vivo,&#8221; and &#8220;Mechanisms and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 induced lung endothelial injury.&#8221; In addition, multiple large research programs have recently been awarded to researchers in the department (including <a href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-awarded-6-million-to-develop-potential-covid-19-treatment/">DOD Technology Award</a> and <a href="https://today.uic.edu/six-uic-scholars-win-nsf-career-awards/">NSF Career Awards</a>).</p>
<p>These Program Project Grants have contributed to and indeed are the major drivers of the rich collaborative environment of the department. Under the leadership of Malik as department head, the department is home to a highly interactive and intellectually robust group of researchers.</p>
<p>This setting has been essential for the  success of new junior faculty members; four new faculty members have recently received independent R01 or R33 grants from NIH, demonstrating their strengths and the demanding nature of the intellectually rigorous environment. These investigators include Sandra Pinho (&#8220;Mechanisms of hematopoietic stem cell engraftment&#8221;), Kiwook Kim (&#8220;Role of membrane-associated macrophages in health and inflammation&#8221;), Dr. Soroush Tahmasebi (&#8220;Translational regulation of tissue resident macrophages by GCN2<em>&#8220;) </em>and Gary Mo (&#8220;Pyroptosis is a Trial-by-Fire Program&#8221;).</p>
<p>The department is also a recipient of a major Training Program supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the NIH. This NIH-sponsored institutional training program, currently in its 29th year, was borne out of our commitment to providing comprehensive training of the next generation of creative and meritorious lung researchers at the predoctoral and postdoctoral levels. The training program emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of cutting-edge research in an environment that fosters independent and creative thinking. The primary objective of the program has been training future research leaders. The success of trainees, both in receipt of independent funding and career development reflects the success of the department’s collaborative training mechanisms.</p>

<p>Pending formal approval by the Board of Trustees at its Nov. 17 meeting, Miranda will take office July 5, 2023, as the 10th chancellor of UIC. She will succeed Chancellor Michael Amiridis, who became President of the University of South Carolina in June.</p>



<p>Miranda, 59, served as provost at Notre Dame through 2021 and remains a member of the faculty in its Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics. As provost, she led the private university’s academic response to the COVID-19 pandemic; helped drive efforts to increase faculty and student diversity, resulting in the most diverse first-year class in school history in 2021; started a transformational leaders program to provide resources to students from under-served backgrounds; and led a bottom up strategic planning process that engaged more than 600 members of the faculty.</p>



<p>Miranda brings a wide range of other leadership experience at Rice University, the University of Michigan and Duke University to her new role as chancellor of UIC and its nearly 34,000 students and 13,000 faculty and staff.</p>



<p>“It is an honor to be chosen to lead one of the country’s great urban universities and to serve this global city and its people,” Miranda said. “I look forward to learning from and working with students, faculty and staff as we work collaboratively with our community partners to meet the pressing challenges and opportunities before us. Together we can provide life-changing educational programs at scale, while fostering the world-class research and engagement our city, state, country and world need.”</p>



<p>University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen said Miranda’s deep experience as a higher education innovator dedicated to access, excellence and community engagement will serve UIC well.</p>



<p>“Marie Lynn comes to UIC and the University of Illinois System as a champion for higher education, a believer in the undisputable impact that a great university can have on the lives of its students, their families and the communities it serves,” Killeen said. “She has been a leader in making certain that higher education is accessible to more and more people, a public good that should be available to students from all backgrounds and income levels. I look forward to working with her to advance UIC and the U of I System.”</p>



<p>At Notre Dame, Miranda is also director of the Children&#8217;s Environmental Health Initiative (CEHI), a research, education and outreach organization committed to fostering environments where all people can prosper. The initiative is best known for its work on childhood lead exposure – contributing to the CDC’s decision to set a more protective standard for childhood blood lead levels, developing strategies for combatting lead in drinking water, and identifying lead in aviation gasoline as a contributor to elevated blood lead levels. CEHI’s most recent work focuses on racial residential segregation and the ways segregated neighborhoods experience greater exposure to social and environmental stressors, which in turn drives health and educational disparities.</p>



<p>Before joining Notre Dame in 2020, Miranda was provost at Rice University from 2015-19. She was responsible for all aspects of the university’s academic, research, scholarly and creative programs, supported by a roughly $700 million annual budget. While at Rice, Miranda also led planning and implementation of $230 million in investments focused on areas such as molecular nanotechnology, data sciences, neuroengineering, inequities and inequalities and general research competitiveness. Her efforts at Rice also included providing a comprehensive set of programs for students from under-served backgrounds – an initiative which substantially closed graduation and time to degree gaps.</p>



<p>At Michigan, Miranda was dean of what was then the School of Natural Resources and Environment from 2012-15, restructuring the doctoral program and improving degree-completion metrics; developing data systems to support evidence-based decision-making in admissions and advising; and reinvigorating the department’s alumni relations operation.</p>



<p>Prior to her work at Michigan, Miranda spent 21 years as a member of the faculty at Duke University, including nine years as director of undergraduate programs for the Nicholas School of the Environment. She also was principal investigator of a research laboratory with roughly 30 full-time staff and 40-plus faculty collaborators. Over the course of her research career, Miranda has been principal investigator or co-principal investigator on over $75 million dollars in research funding.</p>



<p>She is a Phi Beta Kappa, <em>summa cum laude</em> graduate of Duke University, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and economics and was named a Truman Scholar. She has a PhD and Master of Arts from Harvard University, where she held a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.</p>



<p>Miranda is also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>



<p>She was chosen from five finalists and a pool of 40 well-qualified applicants. A committee chaired by UIC Interim Provost and Professor Karen Colley advised system Executive Vice President Avijit Ghosh and Killeen in the search.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Keith Naylor, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine<br /></strong>Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology<br />Director, Gastrointestinal Cancer Prevention Program<br />Co-Chair, Illinois Cancer partnership Screening and Early Detection Subcommittee<br />Co-Lead, Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative Outreach Core</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Examining colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer screening and diagnosis among Chicago Community Health Center patients during the COVID-19 pandemic&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, causing over 600,000 deaths each year. However, many of the most common cancers are highly treatable, or in some cases preventable, with appropriate cancer screening and early detection. Cancer screening can be described as tests that are intended to detect or diagnose cancers in individuals who have no signs or symptoms of cancer. Many cancer screening tests are recommended for healthy men and women as a part of their routine preventative health care, based on age, sex at birth, family history of cancer, as well as other risk factors.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, the cancer death rate has decreased by over 25% in large part due to increased cancer screening and advances in treatment. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions in multiple aspects of health care, including cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment. Nationwide, at the onset of the pandemic, there was an estimated 90% decrease in breast cancer screening, 79% decrease in colon cancer screening, and a 63% decrease in prostate cancer screening. Presently, it is not known how these declines impacted racial/ethnic minority populations, or how they may affect cancer diagnosis and survivorship.</p>
<p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, safety-net health systems, including public hospitals, have served a crucial role in providing health care to the uninsured and individuals with Medicaid insurance. As a vital component of the safety-net health system, Community Health Centers provide comprehensive primary health care services to many communities of color and the medically underserved. In Chicago, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdown caused severe disruptions in health care delivery, including hospitals canceling many elective procedures, such as cancer screening exams, and CHCs limiting in-person visits where cancer screenings often occur.</p>
<p>Chicagoans living in medically underserved community areas, who rely on CHCs for cancer-related screening and other care, may be particularly vulnerable to these disruptions due to the complex interaction of individual, social, and health-system-level factors that are known to contribute to cancer-related health disparities. To achieve health equity and eliminate cancer-related disparities, it is essential to understand which individuals and community areas were impacted most by the pandemic-related effects on cancer screening and diagnosis.</p>
<p>Through research supported by the University of Illinois Cancer Center Community Outreach and Engagement Office, and in collaboration with the Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative, we are examining the impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening rates and subsequent care among patients seen at Alliance Chicago affiliate Community Health Centers.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we are reviewing cancer screening-related information obtained from the Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN). CAPriCORN-affiliated health care organizations include: 392 primary care clinics and 32 hospitals that serve over 12 million patients across Cook County. From this wealth of information, we hope to learn more regarding how cancer screening and diagnosis at Chicago’s CHCs changed over the pandemic.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Safe Exchange Zone offers safe environment for personal sales transactions]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The beginning of the holiday season is a good time to remind online shoppers that while great deals can be found on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Next Door and other community-based websites, there can be dangers associated with meeting a stranger.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, these type of websites can be also used by criminals who intend to take advantage of good-faith buyers or sellers,” UIC Police Chief Kevin Booker said. “In light of recent incidents on campus and in the city, we want to ensure that members of the UIC community can complete this type of sales transaction in a safe way.”</p>
<p>That’s why UICPD has established its police station lobby, 943 W. Maxwell St., as a Safe Exchange Zone in which community members can conduct personal sales transactions in a safe, neutral environment that is comfortable, well-lit and under video surveillance 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement and university staff will not be involved in any way with the transactions,” Booker said. “We even provide designated parking spaces for the parties involved. These arrangements prevent crime from occurring — especially if one of the participants refuses to meet at our location. That’s a sign that they may be up to no good.”</p>
<p>If you must conduct transactions at another location, visit the <a href="https://police.uic.edu/services/safe-exchange-zone/">Safe Exchange Zone webpage</a> for helpful tips about how to stay safe during the sales process.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Realignment aims to support UIC's student success mission]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>University leadership hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvN7TciWogk">Q&amp;A session</a> Nov. 2 to answer questions from the UIC community about the <a href="https://today.uic.edu/re-imagining-and-realigning-student-success/">realignment of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs</a>, which aims to support UIC’s student success mission.</p>
<p>UIC community members asked questions in person during the event at Student Center East and had the opportunity to submit questions and watch virtually.</p>
<p>Panelists included Interim Chancellor Javier Reyes; Karen Colley, acting provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs; Rob Dixon, interim vice chancellor and vice provost for student affairs; Dan Williams, associate vice chancellor for business services; Fred McCall, associate vice chancellor for student engagement <span class="TextRun SCXW181382133 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW181382133 BCX0">and interim dean of students</span></span>; Raphael Florestal-Kevelier, assistant vice chancellor for student health and wellness; Josephine Volpe, associate vice provost for advising development; Kiely Fletcher, associate vice provost for enrollment management; and Aisha El-Amin, associate vice provost for student success and belonging.</p>
<p>Reyes shared the history of the realignment process, which began under the leadership of Rex Tolliver, former vice chancellor for student affairs. The realignment, which officially took effect Oct. 16, creates the new position of vice chancellor and vice provost for student affairs to oversee student affairs, advising, enrollment management and student success initiatives. Dixon is serving in the interim position, and a search will take place after UIC’s next chancellor is named.</p>
<p>“We really had our student life cycle really split between four great leaders that had incredible goals and had incredible plans, but they were not necessarily aligning in how they were getting there,” Reyes said. “The alignment of the mission and structure was what we needed to work on.”</p>
<p>Reyes acknowledged that the university needs to understand and address areas where the university has reached a plateau or has gaps in enrollment, such as African American enrollment and retention of our first-year students and freshmen.</p>
<p>Reyes presented organizational charts that show new reporting lines, and Dixon stressed that all current staff members were retained in the realignment process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colley said the realignment will foster collaboration among Student Affairs and Academic Affairs to better support UIC students.</p>
<p>“The realignment will remove structural barriers that exist right now and allow increased collaboration across all of student services to ensure that student concerns are navigated in a holistic manner with both professionals from Student Affairs and Academic Affairs at the table,” she said. “It will also allow Student Affairs and Academic Affairs to speak as one and to act as a group to identify and address challenges to student success.”</p>
<p>The realignment will support students in many ways, Colley said. For example, it will allow for better coordination between student success units and enrollment services in UIC&#8217;s recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>“We’ll be able to better leverage the community in connections and talents in the leadership of the student success units to enhance recruitment efforts together with the recruiters from enrollment services,” she said.</p>
<p>Colley said other coordinated efforts created by the realignment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing together financial aid, admissions and recruitment professionals to create funding packages for admissions offers rather than sending aid packages only to admitted students.</li>
<li>Enhancing proactive advising strategies to support student success, engagement and well-being.</li>
<li>Ensuring that students are aware of health and wellness resources available to them at UIC as early as during the recruitment process.</li>
<li>Identifying services to support historically underrepresented student populations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next 12 to 18 months, Reyes said, university leadership will target efforts to increase student engagement for all students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we have an alignment at the leadership that can do that,&#8221; Reyes said.</p>
<p>A video of the Q&amp;A session can be viewed online. Additional questions that were not addressed during the session are answered below.</p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: What general student affairs support and accommodations can be offered to students in regional campuses (i.e. Rockford and Peoria)?&nbsp; </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><strong>A:</strong> Each year the Student Fee Advisory Committee, through the student fee setting process makes recommendations for support of the UIC off-site campuses (Rockford, Peoria, and Quad Cities).&nbsp; For this fiscal year (FY 2023) it is projected that the off-site campuses would receive more than $1.7 million in student fee support.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: How will/should the realignment impact committee structure at the college and departmental levels?  </span></b><b><i><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> There aren’t plans to change the existence of campus-level committees such as Dean’s Council, Committee of Associate and Assistant Deans for Student and Academic Affairs (CAAD), etc. where colleges make up the membership. This realignment does provide opportunity for more communication with student affairs areas but would not largely change those internal structures in the colleges.</p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: How will this realignment of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs impact student affairs or academic advising units that occur within the colleges, where reporting lines are internal to the college? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><strong>A:</strong> The realignment will not impact reporting lines internal to the college. Student Affairs will continue to collaborate with college-specific Student Affairs/Advising on orientation, addressing student concerns, and university-wide initiatives focused on student success. </span><span data-contrast="auto">For academic advising units and student affairs units within the colleges, reporting lines will not be changing, which means that our plans for advising development are to increase our partnership and the intention is to have as much positive impact as possible while we know that there will be challenges, one of the commitments advising development is making is to work collaboratively with the college officers to understand the areas that are working best, the pain points, and where we can work to make changes that will engender positive outcomes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: When students feel most vulnerable and need support services to be inviting and accessible, what are succinct ways to make them available for immediate use? How can we enhance the use of our social media, infographics, and other prominent ways to make supports visible? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none"><strong>A:</strong> There are a variety of supports available for students experiencing situations that require emergency intervention. In addition to the direct support resources (e.g. Counseling Centers, Wellness Center/Pop-up food pantry, Dean of Students office, UIC Police Department, Housing, etc.), there are bodies of colleagues including the Student Care Team and Student Response Team that convene to coordinate assistance for students navigating complex issues (e.g. housing, food, financial challenges, etc.) leveraging the vast array of supports available within UIC and the broader Chicago community. With the realignment, there are opportunities to streamline these support structures, expand community capacity (particularly among our student-facing colleagues), to provide immediate support and connect students to resources available when they need them. It is also important to note that the needed supports and the institutional responses vary based on each student’s situation and context, and warrant intentional collaboration for the best possible outcomes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">Q: You mentioned that this realignment will allow for Academic Affairs and Student Affairs to come together with one voice. What has been created to ensure there is intentional staff engagement with both areas to blend the variety of cultures that exist to be more cohesive?</span></b></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong><span style="color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Meetings with Student Affairs leadership spanning both former areas will be held consistently.&nbsp; Leaders at the director level will gather among colleagues in traditionally formulated organizations to discuss the realignment. Then in early January, all realigned student affairs directors will gather for a meet and greet and brainstorming session to look for new collaborations. Events to bring all staff together will continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Q: Are there discussions about how to strategically re-organize office spaces to support the goal of more collaboration across units?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>A:</strong> Staff to support Student Success and Belonging will be moving into Student Services Building.&nbsp; Moving office spaces is an interesting idea to foster collaboration.&nbsp; In upcoming meetings, this idea could be raised and further examined.</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Q: How will we know if this realignment is </span></b><strong>working?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>A:</strong> Metrics for success, such as coordination of financial aid awards, or event/service collaboration, will need to emerge from the units. <span class="NormalTextRun TrackChangeHoverSelectHighlightRed SCXW5955018 BCX0">Student Affairs teams are formulating plans and metrics</span><span class="NormalTextRun TrackChangeHoverSelectHighlightRed SCXW5955018 BCX0">,</span><span class="NormalTextRun TrackChangeHoverSelectHighlightRed SCXW5955018 BCX0"> with</span> input from directors and staff, which will be shared with the campus in the spring.</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Q: I am thrilled to hear the recurring theme of collaboration between professional staff and programs. This highlights how important staff, possibly increased staff, is to all being discussed. Education is a labor-intensive effort! How will the efforts of the campus Human Resources area and the Student Affairs Human Resources area be supported and aligned for expedient and effective search and hire processes? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>A:</strong> Within the last four months, campus Human Resources has implemented two new computer </span> <span data-contrast="auto">programs that will aid in making the search and hiring process more efficient. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Student Affairs Human Resources has operated for over six months with several </span> <span data-contrast="auto">vacancies including the executive director position. As of this writing, the Student </span> <span data-contrast="auto">Affairs Executive Director has been hired. The next step will be to hire the Senior Human </span> <span data-contrast="auto">Resources position and add additional staff to support the student employment and civil </span> <span data-contrast="auto">service hiring processes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"><strong>Q:</strong> </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">I think this realignment is an opportunity to describe better what each of the student-facing offices do to support student engagement, retention and well-being to eliminate confusion about overlap and increase collaboration. Are there strategies to increase education about each other? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>A:</strong> Yes. There will be various opportunities to increase awareness through Student Affairs director’s meetings and other unit meetings to better understand functions and shared responsibilities.</span></p>

<p>For eight weeks, artist Mario Mena led a summer arts class where students put down their thoughts on the environment and the land under their feet.</p>



<p>Working with 12 students from Yollocalli Arts Reach’s Street Art Class as well as the 12 students in the UIC Heritage Garden’s summer internship program, they created the yet unnamed mural, which recently was dedicated outside the UIC Latino Cultural Center during a Day of the Dead celebration.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/latino-cultural-center-director-rosa-cabrera-helps-dedicate-the/"><img loading="lazy" width="387" height="258" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-387x258.jpeg" alt="Rosa Cabrera in front of a colorful mural celebrating urban pollinators" class="wp-image-138598" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-387x258.jpeg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-590x393.jpeg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4-1320x880.jpeg 1320w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Urban-Pollinators_6x4.jpeg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /></a><figcaption>Latino Cultural Center Director Rosa Cabrera helps dedicate the new mural outside of the center.

<p>“Not only did they learn, but I learned a lot working with the youth to create a beautiful image that reflects our Earth and our land,” said Mena, who leads the Street Art Class through Yollocalli Arts Reach, an award winning youth initiative of the National Museum of Mexican Art.</p>



<p>The theme of the mural is the conservation of urban pollinators. It depicts two large colorful monarch butterflies alongside other pollinators flying in a sky of orange and yellow over green fields, as billowing smokestacks spew dark plumes of smoke in the background.</p>



<p>Funding came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service to the UIC Latino Cultural Center and the Heritage Garden.</p>

(Provided photo)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The work is part of the Engaging Diverse Audiences in Monarch Conservation project meant to highlight the Heritage Garden’s monarch butterfly habitat, said Ireri Unzueta Carrasco, lead coordinator and Heritage Garden educator.</p>



<p>Latino Cultural Center Director Rosa Cabrera said the mural, which will be temporarily removed to prepare it for permanent installation, serves to beautify the campus and support our students’ journey at UIC as they “create cultural and artistic responses to social and environmental issues that many of our students are facing.”</p>

<p>Xavier Pacheco, who graduated in May with a bachelor’s degree in industrial design from the School of Design and a minor in psychology, earned the award in the service design category.</p>



<p>He was one of nearly 5,500 students to enter the show, which is in its third year and is run by Arts Thread, a digital platform for emerging artists, in collaboration with the luxury brand Gucci. There were almost 400 art and design schools represented from around the world.</p>



<p>Pacheco’s project, “<a href="https://www.artsthread.com/events/globaldesigngraduateshow/product-architecture-interiors#/project/addressing-the-homeless-community-of-chicago">Addressing the Homeless Community of Chicago</a>,” asks a powerful question: “In a city that takes pride in the close-knit nature of its communities, why is it that the homeless community is largely overlooked by its citizens?”</p>



<p>What started as an idea when he first encountered a homeless encampment near the UIC campus during his sophomore year, was developed and crafted by Pacheco for his thesis over several years of design studies.</p>

<p>“The senior thesis is a representation of who we are as a designer, so I wanted to use this opportunity to really address something that I personally held close to my heart,” said Pacheco, who is originally from Aurora but now lives in Chicago.</p>



<p>Pacheco said that as a city of 2.7 million people, Chicago’s tight-knit communities serve to provide the benefits of what the city has to offer. While the communities are developed to grow together, Pacheco asks about those who are left out.</p>



<p>“I wanted to ask the question, ‘Why is it we as a society inhumanly treat and do not provide the same amount of support for one particular community?” Pacheco said. “The homeless community in Chicago is a close-knit community of individuals who are constantly among us. As a society we don’t even acknowledge that these individuals exist.”</p>



<p>He said he was disturbed by how it has become a social norm to ignore the homeless as they try to interact and ask for anything that would help them. Society instead allows itself to be fueled by the misconception that the homeless are somehow responsible for their plight, due to substance abuse or laziness, Pacheco said.</p>

<p>His project fills the need for public service messaging that targets the homeless to assist them in finding the help they need, he said. In response, he created “AllY” a user-centered support system designed for Chicago&#8217;s homeless community. The system provides information about nearby resources through infographic support maps and connects them to service locations via the Chicago Transit Authority, he said. AllY cards with information about services would also be distributed and shared among the community.</p>



<p>“AllY puts an ally on the streets of Chicago to assist homeless individuals in getting back to where they want to be,” Pacheco said. “I felt that we finally must address this issue and alter the stigma that infects our society’s perspectives toward the homeless community.”</p>



<p>He conducted community surveys on the UIC campus with students and faculty about their interactions with the homeless community. He also interviewed professionals who directly work with the homeless population to tap into their years of experience. In total, he interviewed 185 participants.</p>



<p>After the surveys were conducted, he used the insights he had gleaned to create the support system. He later had the opportunity to speak with an alderperson to share his proposal with the city.</p>



<p>After graduating from UIC, Pacheco began working with Deloitte as a design analyst within its applied design team.</p>



<p>“Chicago’s my home so I wanted to do something that could directly impact where I live,” he said.</p>

<p><a href="https://sae.uic.edu/">UIC’s chapter</a> of the Society of Automotive Engineers Formula team captured first place Oct. 29 during Lawrence Technological University’s annual autumn Grand Prix in Southfield, Michigan.</p>
<p>The autocross-style race challenged the drivers to navigate one at a time through a defined course of cones without hitting any. UIC won with the fastest lap time of 33.96 seconds, edging out the second-place team that recorded a time of 34.24 seconds.</p>
<p>“When the course opened, we were one of the first teams on the track, and we started putting down competitive times right away,” said Antonio Salerno, team captain and a student in mechanical and industrial engineering.</p>
<p>UIC competed against Lawrence Technological University, Grand Valley State University, Michigan State University, University of Michigan-Dearborn, University of Toledo, Wayne State University and Western Michigan University.</p>
<p>The win was not easy for the young engineers as they faced challenges before and during the race that almost knocked them out of the competition.</p>
<p>The day before the team left for the race, they found two broken engine mounts on their vehicle. They immediately started disassembling the car to assess the damage and develop a plan of action.</p>
<p>Everyone came together to brainstorm, and once they knew what had to be done, they got busy cutting, grinding and welding to repair and reinforce the damaged parts.</p>
<p>“Once the car was repaired and put back together, we tested it and tuned the suspension to make sure we could show up to the competition and be competitive,” Salerno said.</p>
<p>The students also came together as a team when the car had a small electrical problem halfway through the event. Undeterred, they got to work and had the car back on the track in less than an hour.</p>
<p>“Everyone on the team was ready to get to work whenever there was a problem. The team worked well together at the competition and in the weeks leading up to it,” Salerno said. “All of the amazing teamwork is why we were able to show up and instantly run fast laps and find ways to be faster throughout the day.”</p>
<p>The UIC team is made up of Salerno, Ben Hawkinson, Amaan Hussain, Mohamad El-Saghir, Jonathon Simon, Fabricio J. Gomez, Oswaldo Jimenez, Vincent McNulty, Kiro Mikhaiel, Abanoub Saad, Damian Pudelko, David Podstawski, and Cameron Rozek. Team members Tanseem Abbasi, Alex Guha, and Ted Bolbuc contributed to the win, but could not make it to the event.</p>
<p>SAE@UIC is a student-run engineering organization centered around designing, manufacturing, testing and racing custom single-seat race cars. The competitions test the student’s engineering and project management skills and provide students with engineering and problem-solving experiences beyond the classroom. Additionally, the students take part in outreach opportunities including K-12 school lectures, STEM events, company visits and a booth at the Chicago Auto Show.</p>

<p>After facing early construction delays, supply chain issues and a variety of unforeseen challenges, the east campus Quad area will reopen later this week. The Quad renovations were part of the <a href="https://cppm.uic.edu/planning/2018-implementation-plan/">2018 UIC Master Plan Update</a> and include a variety of amenities that encourage student interaction, provide enhanced experiences for the UIC community, and promote sustainability.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to reopen this important and highly valued campus space for use by the entire UIC community,” said John Coronado, vice chancellor for administrative services.</p>
<p>Renovations that have been completed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installation of 20-foot-wide sidewalks.</li>
<li>Creation of a central green space in which programming, featured speakers and a variety of student activities can take place.</li>
<li>Construction of a stage with ramp access and electric power for events.</li>
<li>Installation of a stormwater detention tank that can hold over 60,000 gallons of diverted water.</li>
<li>Planting of shade trees and native species plants.</li>
<li>Installation of a variety of seating options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supply chain issues continue to impact the project&#8217;s completion. Wood slats to finish the 18-inch-high benches around the central green space and additional furniture will be added in late November.  Temporary lighting will remain in place until new light poles arrive in the spring. Fencing will remain around the center and southern portions of the Quad until the grass takes root and the remaining furniture is installed.</p>
<p>The project team was able to find creative workarounds for some supply chain issues that kept construction moving. For example, when they learned of the long lead time to obtain a prefabricated stormwater detention tank, plans were changed, and the tank was built onsite.</p>
<p>The project team also encountered a host of unknown issues once site excavation began. This included the discovery of previously unknown electrical lines that impeded installation of the stormwater tank, an abandoned brick-lined sewer vault that was partially filled with water, deteriorated city water lines that leaked, and massive 1964-era concrete foundations that once held up granite slabs for former campus elevated walkways.</p>
<p>“Finding the concrete foundations from the elevated walkways during excavation was a major surprise,” Coronado said. “Because they were in the way of the stormwater catch basins, they had to be removed to complete the project. But despite the delays caused by all the unforeseen issues that we experienced, the quad is now ready to serve the needs of the UIC community for years to come in a more interactive, engaging and sustainable way.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2792748#:~:text=In%20Chicago%2C%20Black%20and%20Hispanic,being%2029%25%20of%20Chicago's%20population."><span data-contrast="none">City of Chicago data shows</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> that Chicago’s Black residents made up 43% of “first wave” deaths from COVID-19 in 2020, despite being only 29% of city residents, while Hispanic residents accounted for 48% of COVID-19 cases, despite being just 29% of the city population.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Health disparities like these have prompted the Health Resources and Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to award the University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health $1.5 million in scholarship funds from the American Rescue Plan. The new funding will suppor</span><span data-contrast="none">t</span><span data-contrast="none"> 57 Master of Public Health students over the next three years.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">UIC is one of 29 institutions nationwide and the only institution in Illinois to secure a grant from the funds. UIC’s program will provide scholarships for in-state students who are committed to serving medically underserved communities throughout Illinois, with preference for those who come from traditionally underrepresented groups, specifically Black, Hispanic, Native American or tribal, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander students. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“Over </span><span data-contrast="auto">the last 10 to 15 years, there has been a huge amount of attrition in the public health workforce, and COVID really illustrated the importance of having a strong public health workforce,” UIC School of Public Health Dean Dr. Wayne Giles said. “Our intent is to provide a more diverse workforce that will help to get communities focused on the importance and value of prevention, provide more access to care, and implement policies to promote health and well-being, so that all people can achieve their optimal health.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Prior to the grant award, 34% of the school’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">in-state <span data-contrast="none">Master of Public Health</span> students were Black or Latino</span><span data-contrast="none">, and nearly 35% of all program graduates took jobs in medically underserved communities upon degree completion.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">School of Public Health Assistant Dean John Slavick helped prepare the proposal for the grant, along with Senior Associate Dean Jamie Chriqui, who led the effort, and Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion Nadine Peacock. </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Slavick believes UIC’s track record in educating underrepresented students and providing health workers for underserved communities played a role in distinguishing the university’s application for the grant, for which UIC received the maximum amount available from HRSA.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“We have a long history of people working in these communities, and we have good connections with the public health departments and alumni, whom we can engage for mentorship and as preceptors for internship programs for these students</span>,&#8221; Slavick said.</p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">School leadership credits the award in part to longstanding partnerships with the Chicago Department of Public Health and the Illinois Department of Public Health, along with letters of support from the Cook County Department of Public Health, the Kane County Health Department, the Lake County Health Department, the Illinois Public Health Institute, the Illinois Public Health Association, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors, all of whom attested to their interest in engaging the scholarship students for their required practicum training as well as long-term employment.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The majority of the 57 scholarships will cover full tuition and fees for recipients, with a portion of the funds set aside for nontraditional students the program calls life scholars. These are community-funded workers who were trained by UIC during the height of the pandemic to do contact tracing and connect vulnerable individuals with services. </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“This is an amazing cohort of people who may have been underemployed and now have a passion for public health and want to get back to school,” Peacock said.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The students who receive the new scholarships will receive additional academic support to help them transition to the master’s program and will be enrolled in a special public health leadership course. They also will be encouraged to take core courses in emergency preparedness, health disparities, public health geographic information systems and other topics that will prepare them&nbsp;to become immediate contributors in different public health roles. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“Our goal is to really prepare them with not just the formal public health training, but also the soft skills that we&#8217;ve heard from our Partner Advisory Board are so critical for students coming out of public health programs and going into the workforce, including leadership and management training and strong communications skills,” Chriqui said.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Public health workers serve communities in a variety of ways, educating residents on the fundamentals of health, diet and hygiene; connecting individuals with health care providers; advocating for community needs; and offering basic health services like vaccinations or wellness visits. They may also help to shape public policy, work as epidemiologists or biostatisticians, lead sanitation processes or determine how environmental issues impact community health.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">UIC&#8217;s School of Public Health is ranked 16th in the nation according to U.S. News &amp; World Report and it is the only accredited public health school in Illinois.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Listeners of WBEZ 91.5 public radio&#8217;s &#8220;Reset&#8221; news program recently had the opportunity to hear about the ghost stories that have haunted Hull-House since its inception.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/the-haunting-of-chicagos-hull-house/89de4719-2acf-401b-b408-fbc243f3dc88">&#8220;The haunting of Hull-House, from urban legends to ghost stories&#8221;</a> feature on &#8220;Reset,&#8221; which is hosted by Sasha-Ann Simons, transmitted live Oct. 26 from the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum at the University of Illinois Chicago campus. Simons had an on-air interview with Nadia Maragha, the museum’s education coordinator, about ghostly happenings in the historic settlement home.</p>



<p>The two-hour radio program was in preparation for the upcoming Halloween holiday and included interviews with Chicago historian and author Adam Selzer, who runs tours focused on paranormal activities in Chicago. In addition, the program shared family-friendly Halloween activities.</p>



<p>As Maragha spoke with Simons, she discussed the history of the settlement house, which was founded in 1889 by Addams and Ellen Gates Starr to provide assistance to impoverished people and immigrants. The show took place in the former residential dining hall, one of only two buildings remaining. The original Hull-House complex grew to be 13 buildings at its height, Maragha said.</p>



<p>Maragha told Simons that ghost stories had become part of Hull-House since even before Addams and Gates started the settlement home and go back to when the original owner’s wife died in the home in the 1800s. Her ghost, dubbed the Lady in White, has been said to appear over the years in the other remaining original building, which was where Addams and Gates lived and where the woman had died. </p>



<p>But the most notorious story is the Devil Baby ghost, which <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1916/10/the-devil-baby-at-hull-house/305428/">Addams herself first wrote about</a> in 1916. Maragha said Addams described learning from several neighborhood women how a story had been circulating that a baby with red skin, a tail and spewing profanities had been born in the home.</p>



<p>“It was a phenomenon that swept the neighborhood and came out of nowhere,” Maragha said. “Over time they found that this urban legend had started circulating through the community, and it was a really rich rumor.”</p>



<p>Maragha said several versions of the story popped up, which gave different scenarios about its origin. Each focused on the father of the child wishing for a “devil child” rather than bearing the responsibility of rearing another child.</p>



<p>“This is definitely giving Salem Witch Trials vibes. The community starts believing a devil infiltrating the neighborhood. Did people really believe this story?” Simons asked.</p>



<p>“They absolutely did,” Maragha said, adding that people stormed the home demanding to see the baby and were willing to bribe their way inside. “Jane Addams says that at some points, there were literally lines going down the end of the block.”</p>



<p>As Addams investigated the rumor and its origins, Maragha said Addams discovered that it was a way women used to communicate things they were experiencing at the time. Maragha said while urban lore was new at the time, folklore had been used to make sense of the world around them and talk about what they were experiencing with each other.</p>



<p>“Families were often experiencing domestic violence and abuse in general, and here was this story where the patriarch of the family is inflicting this abuse, and there are condemnations and punishment,” Maragha said.</p>



<p>Maragha also spoke about <a href="https://today.uic.edu/jane-addams-hull-house-museum-celebrates-a-spooky-october/">other stories</a>, including a former fountain that purportedly served as a portal to hell and how the Lady in White would allegedly appear to Addams, Gates and others over the years.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“MATEC will build on the lessons learned from a previous project carried out in the past four years when we worked with 16 academic institutions with accredited programs of medicine, nursing and pharmacy in the Midwest,” said Dr. Ricardo Rivero, MATEC’s executive director and a co-principal investigator on the grant. “With this project, we successfully integrated content from the National HIV Curriculum E-Learning Platform into their existing curricula.

<p><span data-contrast="none">According to Corina Wagner, MATEC research and evaluation manager and co-principal investigator on the new grant, “The project will assist existing faculty, especially those who are not HIV specialists and who may lack the HIV clinical background, with knowledge of HIV content, teaching methods and ways to address potential students’ reluctance to engage with vulnerable communities such as the ones most affected by HIV.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Rivero said, “By doing so, the project will continue to address students’ and residents’ attitudinal barriers to care for people living with or at risk of acquiring HIV, and we expect that those who have been trained in HIV care through the integrated National HIV Curriculum will be able to identify, address or properly refer their patients with HIV-related needs, particularly for chronic illness interventions that appear as a growing number of people living with HIV age.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Other key faculty and co-investigators on the new grant include Dr. Mahesh Patel, assistant professor at the College of Medicine; Blake Max, clinical associate professor at the College of Pharmacy; and Dr. Sarah Henkle, assistant professor of clinical family medicine at the College of Medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>A delegation of physicians from Ukraine, including Dr. Oleksandr Sarzhevskyi, Dr. Oleksandr Serhiienko and Dr. Nataliia Mizynets, spent a full day Oct. 19 in meetings and tours with faculty, physicians, and administrators at the University of Illinois College of Medicine and the UI Health Hospital &amp; Clinics.</p>
<p>The purpose of the delegation’s visit to the Chicago area was to learn how U.S. medical schools, hospitals and blood banks are developing and managing blood transfusion services in order to modernize and enhance their country&#8217;s services at this critical time. The visit is being sponsored by the Congressional Office for International Leadership and coordinated by the Council of International Programs in Chicago.</p>
<p>Dr. Sally Campbell-Lee, interim head and professor in the department of pathology designed the visit, with key participation by Dr. Damiano Rondelli, Michael Reese Professor of Hematology; Dr. Anna Beckman, associate professor of anesthesiology; Dr. Sujata Gaitonde, professor of clinical pathology; Dr. Ulana Leskiw, associate professor of clinical anesthesiology; and Dr. David Allison, assistant professor of clinical pathology.</p>
<p>The delegation also visited several other Chicago area institutions, including Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, Vitalant and Elmhurst Hospital.</p>
<p>“We almost don’t sleep because we have to respond to (our places of work), and the needs in Ukraine and, at the same time, learn here,” said Dr. Mizynets, head of the blood bank at Rivne Regional Clinical Hospital, through a translator. The Chicago area visit is important, she said, “because we receive both civil and servicemen during the war, and the number of wounded will only grow.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[UI Health surgeons perform first SinglePort robotic sleeve gastrectomy ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Rosa Vazquez says she has lost more than 30 pounds and reduced her need for diabetes, blood pressure and cholesterol medications by half after undergoing&nbsp;a minimally invasive surgery at UI Health that requires fewer incisions than standard robotic weight-loss surgeries.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Vazquez, 40, from West Lawn, has a family history of diabetes and has struggled with obesity-related health conditions for most of her life. She decided to undergo the surgery at UI Health — the University of Illinois Chicago’s health system — because nothing else had worked for her and she wanted to prolong her life.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">“I have been on medications for so long, but now I am talking only half the doses I needed before. My goal is to not take any medications,” Vazquez said. “I have more energy. I can do things like walk up the stairs without getting short of breath. I haven’t been able to do these things for 20 years.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Vazquez’s doctors say this is the first time the weight-loss surgery, called a sleeve gastrectomy, has been performed with robotic surgery techniques using a single-port robot, which operates through a single incision.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">“The single-port robotic approach is minimally invasive and has single incision compared to traditional multi-port laparoscopic or multi-port robotic procedures — this means the surgery is more cosmetic, less invasive and more comfortable for patients,” said Dr. Francesco Bianco, a UI Health surgeon and UIC associate professor of surgery at the College of Medicine who specializes in robotic and metabolic surgery.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">“There is just one tiny cut on the side of the belly button,” Bianco said. “This helps to reduce patient fears about the surgery and with only one incision, patients generally have less pain and a faster return to normal activity following the procedure.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">During Vazquez’s surgery, Bianco and his colleagues removed about 80% of her stomach to aid weight loss.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Diet and exercise alone work for less than 10% of people in the long term,” said Dr. Chandra Hassan, UI Health surgeon and director of the Bariatric Surgery Program. “This is because there are a number of metabolic processes in the body that contribute to obesity and diabetes that are unaffected by these approaches. With surgery, we can remove part of the stomach and address things like hunger hormones with much more long-term efficiency.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">“While surgery is not a cure for obesity or related health conditions, it does put the diabetes into a kind of instant remission of up to 90%,” said Hassan, who was on Vazquez’s surgical team.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">The new procedure opens doors for more patients to access this kind of treatment for obesity. Bianco said that the less invasive approach also could mean that, one day, sleeve gastrectomies may be done in the outpatient setting, where the patient goes home the same day after surgery.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Bianco and Hassan performed Vazquez’s surgery in March, after planning and practicing for the first-of-its-kind procedure in UIC’s </span><a href="https://sitl.us/"><span data-contrast="none">Surgical Innovation and Training Laboratory</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> at the College of Medicine.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">UI Health performs about 400 metabolic surgeries each year, making the hospital one of the busiest in Chicago for this type of care. In the last two years, about three-quarters of these surgeries have been done with robotic technology.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">UIC Professor and Head of Surgery Dr. Enrico Benedetti said the hospital expects to expand its capacity for robotic and other surgeries beginning this fall, when the </span><a href="https://hospital.uillinois.edu/about-ui-health/capital-projects/specialty-care-building"><span data-contrast="none">UI Health Specialty Care Building</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is expected to open. The building will be the home of a new outpatient surgery clinic.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Our surgical programs have been operating at capacity for many years and with new space for procedures in the Bruno and Sallie Pasquinelli Outpatient Surgery Center, we will be able to care for more patients with innovative and minimally invasive surgical techniques such as this one, led by Dr. Bianco and Dr. Hassan,” said Benedetti, who is also the Warren H. Cole Chair In Surgery.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

<p>The University of Illinois Chicago is one of six institutions that will split an $8.8 million National Science Foundation grant to develop theories, research methods and tools to help expand and tailor the field of STEM education to support Black students.</p>



<p>The five-year project will be led by Terrell Morton, UIC assistant professor of identity and justice in STEM education. He will serve as the principal investigator for the overall project and for UIC specifically. Other universities involved in the effort include Tennessee State University, the University of Texas at Austin, American University, Georgia State University and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.</p>



<p>The title of the project is, “Collaborative Research: EHR Racial Equity: Examining Blackness in Postsecondary STEM Education through a Multidimensional-Multiplicative Lens.”</p>



<p>Morton, who is in the department of educational psychology in the College of Education, said that while there is a lot of desire to foster racial equity, particularly at the policy level in STEM education, the assumption is often that every Black person is homogeneous, simply because of their shared racial identity.</p>



<p>“We assume that every Black person needs the exact same thing because of their racial identity as Black,” Morton said. “The purpose of this project is to say that not every Black person is the same, even if they all racially identify as Black.”</p>



<p>The goal is to develop and tailor racial equity-focused policies and practices in STEM education and to facilitate increased access and sustained engagement in STEM for Black undergraduate students. This includes looking at what “Blackness means for individuals,” Morton said.</p>



<p>Morton points to contemporary literature that suggests that the embodiment of “Blackness” differs according to many dimensions, including ethnic identity, where people grew up and if they are the first in their family to attend college, how far back their ancestry is traced in the U.S. and other factors.</p>



<p>“As a result of these different identity factors in addition to our gender identity, sexuality, religion and other salient identities we may understand the world differently,” he said. “If we want to create policies in STEM education that are equitable and pay attention to how people see the world, we need to create new tools and theories and outcomes.”</p>



<p>The schools involved in the project are purposely diverse and include two historically Black colleges and universities, two predominantly white institutions, one majority Black institution and one Hispanic-Serving Institution. They are also located in geographically distinct areas, including the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Southwest and Midwest regions, to gain a broader representation to analyze.</p>



<p>Each of the schools will serve as its own research site but will share protocols, recruitment practices and perspectives. Each of the institutions will implement the protocols in their regions. For example, Morton will be tasked with taking the created protocols and instruments and implementing them in the Chicago region through the recruitment of Black undergraduate students at four-year universities in the Chicago area who will share how they understand their identity as Black within STEM.  Eventually, a national survey would be created and analyzed.</p>



<p>“This project will produce tools of analysis and translational products that will change how institutional and organizational policies, practices and future research treat Black people in STEM, thereby promoting tailored resources and supports to meet Black people’s nuanced needs,” according to the grant.</p>



<p>The funding comes from the NSF’s Racial Equity in STEM Education program. The program supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of STEM education and workforce.</p>



<p>“This program aligns with NSF’s core value of supporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the nation’s diversity of demographic groups, regions and types of organizations,” according to NSF officials.</p>



<p>Morton is a scholar-activist whose research focuses on identity expression in STEM education for marginalized groups. Morton began at UIC in August and has experience as a co-founder of the nonprofit Christine W. Avery Learning Center in Asheville, North Carolina. Prior to UIC, he was an assistant professor of identity and justice in STEM education from the University of Missouri-Columbia.</p>



<p>He earned his doctorate in education – learning sciences and psychological studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and his Master of Science in neurobiology and neurosciences from the University of Miami. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Chemistry degree at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.</p>



<p>Other partners involved in the project include, Andrea Tyler at Tennessee State University; Tia Madkins and Yasmiyn Irizzary at the University of Texas at Austin; Shari Watkins and Brian McGowan at American University; Nickolaus Ortiz at Georgia State University and Paula Groves Price at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. Additionally, Ashley Woodson at Albion College; Jennifer Adams at the University of Calgary; Whitney McCoy at Duke University and ReAnna Roby at Vanderbilt University play critical roles in the design and execution of this project.</p>

<p>The University of Illinois Chicago’s Institute for the Humanities will celebrate the release of <a href="https://nupress.northwestern.edu/9780810143685/growing-up-chicago/">“Growing Up Chicago”</a> with a special roundtable gathering of several authors and writers who contributed to the anthology, which features 23 coming-of-age stories and essays that reflect the diversity of the city and its metropolitan area.</p>



<p>The event, which provides the opportunity to hear from and meet with some authors and editors of the book, will be held Oct. 26, 5-7 p.m., at the Institute for the Humanities, Behavioral Sciences Building, Suite 153, 1007 W. Harrison St. Admission is free and open to the public. Refreshments will be served. No registration is required. For more information, email David Schaafsma at <a href="mailto:schaaf1@uic.edu">schaaf1@uic.edu</a>.</p>



<p>“Growing Up Chicago,” which was published as part of Northwestern University Press&#8217; Second to None: Chicago Stories series, features many UIC-affiliated writers. The anthology’s foreword is written by Luis Alberto Urrea, UIC professor of English and distinguished professor in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Authors featured at the event will include Anne Calcagno, Saja Elshareif, Jessie Ann Foley, Daiva Markelis, James McManus and Tony Romano, several of whom are UIC alumni.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chicago author S.L. Wisenberg describes the anthology as “An entertaining and touching tumble of sexual awakenings, identity quests, dangerous liaisons, early sorrows, boundary crossings, and 16-inch softball. There’s a different Chicago in each piece — the city serves as witness, backdrop, companion, solace.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors of “Growing Up Chicago” include David Schaafsma, professor of English and director of the Program in English Education at UIC; Roxanne Pilat, UIC doctoral graduate from the English department’s Program for Writers; and Lauren DeJulio Bell, an academic advisor and program specialist in the UIC Honors College. Several undergraduate students worked on the project, including Megan Gallardo, a current research assistant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>University of Illinois Chicago cultural anthropologist Nadine Naber is the recipient of the American Studies Association’s 2022 Carl Bode-Norman Holmes Pearson Prize, which recognizes the outstanding achievement of an individual who has dedicated a lifetime of work to the mission and values of American studies.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/nadine-naber_09-34-29_4x6/"><img loading="lazy" width="271" height="406" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nadine-Naber_09.34.29_4x6-271x406.png" alt="Nadine Naber, UIC professor of global Asian studies and gender and women’s studies" class="wp-image-137778" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nadine-Naber_09.34.29_4x6-271x406.png 271w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nadine-Naber_09.34.29_4x6-172x258.png 172w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nadine-Naber_09.34.29_4x6-768x1152.png 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nadine-Naber_09.34.29_4x6-1024x1536.png 1024w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nadine-Naber_09.34.29_4x6-500x750.png 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nadine-Naber_09.34.29_4x6-1000x1500.png 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nadine-Naber_09.34.29_4x6.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a><figcaption>Nadine Naber, UIC professor of global Asian studies and gender and women’s studies.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Naber, a UIC professor of global Asian studies and gender and women’s studies who is affiliated with the department of anthropology, will be honored Nov. 3 at an awards ceremony during the association’s annual meeting in New Orleans.</p>



<p>Her research challenges how racism, classism, heterosexism and U.S.-led empire-building impact Arab and Arab American communities and explores the possibilities for feminists of color to lead social movements to build a world without oppression.</p>



<p>In a nomination letter from Evelyn Alsultany, associate professor of American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California, Naber is cited as one of the field’s leading scholars in the areas of transnational Arab and decolonial abolitionist feminisms.</p>



<p>“Dr. Naber’s work has markedly transformed and updated the field of American Studies around some of the most urgent issues of our times. Her extraordinary contributions reverberate across many areas in our field, producing groundbreaking impacts theoretically, internationally, methodologically, publicly and institutionally,” Alsultany wrote.</p>



<p>Naber is author of “Arab America: Gender, Cultural Politics, and Activism.” She is co-editor of the books “Race and Arab Americans”; “Arab and Arab American Feminisms,” which won the 2012 Arab American Book Award; “The Color of Violence”; and “Towards the Sun.”</p>



<p>For more than two decades she has been connecting scholars, students and the public to issues related to activism and community engagement.</p>



<p>“By mentoring faculty and students to ‘Liberate their Research’ and collectively founding and leading several academic programs and community-based organizations, Dr. Naber has institutionalized the contributions named above across campuses, national and disciplinary borders, and communities, and has therefore given permission to more and more American Studies scholars to continue growing intersectional, decolonial, transnational, social movement-led research and practice,” Alsultany wrote.</p>



<p>At the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Naber co-founded the Arab and Muslim American Studies Program. At UIC, Naber was the founding director of the Arab American Culture Center when it was created in 2016. Under her leadership, the center launched educational and cultural programming for the campus; supported networks for international, undergraduate and graduate students; provided research experiences for students interested in developing research that supports Arab American communities; and established an Arab American graduation recognition for the UIC campus.</p>



<p>Since coming to UIC in 2013, she has taught courses in the areas of Arab American studies, Middle East women’s studies, global feminisms, activism and social change, Asian and Arab American solidarity, and feminist methodologies.</p>



<p>Naber’s work has previously been recognized with the YWCA’s Y-Women&#8217;s Leadership Award, an international fellowship from the Open Society Foundation, a grant from the Humanities Without Walls consortium and UIC’s Silver Circle Teaching Award.</p>



<p>Naber is currently co-authoring a book on the significance of activism led by people who are mothering and caregiving in the face of police violence, attacks on undocumented migrants, and colonization and war.</p>



<p>The American Studies Association’s Carl Bode-Norman Holmes Pearson Prize honors two early pioneers in American studies, both of whom were integral in the early movement to institutionalize American studies. Carl Bode was the founder and first president of the American Studies Association. He was a literary critic and cultural historian known for The American Lyceum, and he spent his academic career in the American Civilization program at the University of Maryland, College Park. Norman Holmes Pearson was an editor, literary critic and archivist, and he co-founded the American Civilization program at Yale University in the 1940s. </p>



<p>Founded in 1951, the American Studies Association is the oldest and largest academic association dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of U.S. culture and history in a global context.</p>

<p>During the month of September, the Office of Planning, Sustainability, and Project Management organized four campus events: the Campus Electronic Recycling Collection, UIC Tree Planting, Great Stuff Exchange, and Swap and Recycle Pop-Up. Hundreds of students, staff and faculty were able to attend and participate in the events, which were made possible through the support of UIC’s <a href="https://sustainability.uic.edu/student-experience/eco-volunteer/">Eco Volunteers</a>.</p>
<p>UIC’s annual <a href="https://sustainability.uic.edu/green-campus/recycling/cerc/">Campus Electronic Recycling Collection </a> is an electronics recycling event where the UIC community is invited to drop off any unwanted electronics, including personal electronics. At separate events on the east and west sides of campus, the sustainability team collected over 15 pallets of electronics that would otherwise have gone to a landfill. Many electronics contain resource-intensive rare earth metals that make recycling critical.</p>
<p>Through a partnership with the <a href="https://mortonarb.org/">Morton Arboretum</a> and in honor of its centennial year celebration, 46 trees were planted near the intersection of Harrison and Leavitt streets Sept. 16. More than 30 people signed up to plant trees that both beautify UIC’s urban environment and contribute to the university’s sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>“UIC’s urban campus is an ideal location to expand Chicago’s tree canopy,” said Carly Provost-Rizor, superintendent of grounds and building maintenance. “New plantings provide a myriad of benefits, including reducing heat island effects, managing stormwater runoff and increasing species biodiversity. Each of these achievements is important to the university and surrounding communities.”</p>
<p>For 30 years, the sustainability team at UIC has hosted the <a href="https://sustainability.uic.edu/green-campus/recycling/great-stuff-exchange/">Great Stuff Exchange</a>. Throughout the year, the sustainability team collects new and gently used office supplies from campus departments and gives them away to UIC students, staff and faculty. This year’s event was held Sept. 21, and over 400 attendees learned something new about sustainability at UIC or obtained useful items for themselves.</p>
<p>In partnership with <a href="https://sustainability.uic.edu/events/earth-month-swap-and-special-recycling-pop-up/">Reduce Waste Chicago</a> and <a href="https://www.ecoandtheflamingo.com/">Eco &amp; the Flamingo</a>, UIC students and employees got a chance to participate in the Swap and Recycle Pop-Up Sept. 28. Participants were able to bring books and clean clothes in good condition for swapping as well as recycle items that cannot traditionally go in the regular recycling stream but can be sorted and recycled through specialty methods.</p>
<p>“When it comes to sustainability, we all have a role to play. These September events, though small in overall impact, give everyone at UIC a chance to take tangible action and put our university values into practice,” said Liz Bosarge, zero waste program director. “In addition, these campus events also help UIC become more sustainable and get closer to achieving its <a href="https://sustainability.uic.edu/plans/uicclimatecommitments/zero-waste-campus/">Zero Waste Climate Commitment</a>.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[India’s leading School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) Delhi and [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">India’s leading School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) Delhi and the University of Illinois Chicago will sign a Memo of Understanding Oct. 18. Leveraging matchless resources, including geographical locations at the heart of two great cities, the MOU positions these two exceptional public institutions to advance joint research and scholarly collaborations around some of the most pressing issues of an increasingly urbanized world.</p>
<p>Funded by the central government of India, SPA is recognized as an &#8220;institution of national importance&#8221; by the country’s parliament. SPA offers undergraduate programs in planning and architecture and more than 12 graduate programs. UIC’s College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, ranked fifth in the nation for its urban policy program by US News &amp; World Report (2023), promotes just, resilient and livable communities. CUPPA conducts engaged and applied research advancing the larger public good via diverse fields like urban planning, public policy and city design.</p>
<p>Professors Sanjeev Vidyarthi, director of the City Design program in CUPPA, and Ashok Kumar, dean of academic affairs at SPA, are longtime collaborators. India’s recently launched National Education Policy encourages international exchange of ideas and knowledge, an idea that UIC takes seriously, Vidyarthi said.</p>
<p>“The MOU will pave the way for our two leading urban-centered research institutions specializing in city planning and design to work together in the face of an uncertain urban future worldwide starting with issues facing our two great cities and then moving on to future projects,&#8221; Vidyarthi said.</p>
<p>The Republic of India is world’s most populous democracy, home to over 1.3 billion people, with an estimated GDP of $3 trillion, the fifth highest in the world. India ranks second for international students pursuing higher education in the U.S., with more than 167,582 Indian students enrolling during the 2020-21 academic year. UIC has well-established, long-term scholarly ties with India and currently enrolls nearly 1700 students from the country.</p>

<p>Several dozen students, faculty members and alumni gathered recently at the University of Illinois Chicago to celebrate the inception of a new major and Bachelor of Arts degree in global Asian studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GLAS major is being offered in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and is the first of its kind in the Midwest. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-announces-newly-created-global-asian-studies-major/" target="_blank">program</a> engages in interdisciplinary study of Asia and transoceanic and transnational Asian diasporas. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Anna Guevarra, founding director of GLAS, told the audience members gathered at Student Center East that the major had been an idea that took more than 30 years to become a reality. She said it was an initiative led by students who used petitions, news stories, news releases and memoranda of understanding to get the university to offer more courses related to Asian American issues as well as greater representation.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was fought collectively and collaboratively with faculty, students and staff working together; this has been a dream since 1991,&#8221; said Guevarra, referencing a flyer for a “speak out” that students organized in 2006.</p>



<p>Guevarra, associate professor of global Asian studies, remarked that this dream also called for supporters to think beyond identity politics, with the students themselves explaining that “Asian Americans aren’t the only students underserved when Asian American studies does not exist.”</p>

(Photo: Hunter Atha)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Amalia Pallares, vice chancellor for diversity, equity and engagement, said that as the head diversity officer in the university and as professor in the department of Latin American and Latino studies, she could not be happier to welcome the new major, which she called, “an incredible achievement.”</p>



<p>“It was really a distant dream for students and faculty in the 90s, and it has taken three decades to come to fruition,” Pallares said.</p>



<p>She said that as a longtime member of the UIC faculty, one of her earliest memories on campus was seeing Asian students marching to demand Asian American resources and programming that “were pretty much nonexistent.”</p>



<p>The movement led to the creation of the Asian American Resource and Cultural Center and continued through the years, leading to the hiring of more Asian American faculty, the establishment of an academic unit and then eventually the offering of global Asian studies as a minor and now as a major, Pallares said.</p>



<p>“I can say that none of these things were easy, there were many challenges, many instances where those who were advocating for this were told there were no resources, no possibilities, no options,” Pallares said. “There were those who believed in the positive — and when they were told there were no resources found them elsewhere.”</p>



<p>Lisa Freeman, interim dean for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, said the global Asian studies program has been a “vibrant” and “dynamic” part of the college officially since 2016, but it is the culmination of decades of activism on the part of the campus and community partners. She credited Guevarra for her tireless efforts.</p>



<p>Freeman said the major brings together two “disparate but related disciplines,” Asian studies and Asian American studies. She said the program is interdisciplinary and includes courses and disciplines from art history to history and from political science to anthropology and sociology.</p>



<p>“The global Asian studies major is the first of its kind in the Midwest and only one of a handful of such programs nationwide,” Freeman said. “Professor Guevarra has worked incredibly hard to bring this program to life. She has not only built an academic program, she has built a community.”</p>

<p>As part of the celebration, alumni were invited back on campus to discuss their time as UIC students and to celebrate the culmination of their efforts for greater representation.</p>



<p>One of those alumni was Naomi Leilani Salcedo, who in 2016 graduated from UIC with a Bachelor of Sociology degree and a minor in Asian American studies. Salcedo said when they and their classmates arrived at UIC in 2012, they were first exposed to ethnic studies.</p>



<p>“When I first came to campus, immediately I found AARCC (Asian American Resource and Cultural Center), and it felt like home, it really felt like a community,” Salcedo said. </p>



<p>Salcedo and their friends then took Asian American studies courses, minored in what was then called the Asian American studies program, and joined the program’s student advisory board. Upon graduating in 2016, Salcedo co-produced a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t1Vl3bG-9c&amp;t=17s">video tribute</a> to the program’s transition to global Asian studies. </p>



<p>Six years later, upon learning that GLAS was now a major, they said, “I felt a wave of emotion and in awe of collective power. My time at UIC ASAM was a transformative experience — one that lives out through my current work empowering and serving immigrants and refugees in Chicagoland.”</p>



<p>Brandon Mita, who graduated from UIC in 2006 with a bachelor’s degree in political science, served as the chairperson of the Asian American Coalition Committee. Mita recalled working with other Asian students and faculty to first get the cultural center, then Asian American Awareness Month, and later Asian American studies. Mita recalled trying to draw interest to their rally, dubbed “the speak out,” and fighting to get flyers up.</p>



<p>“I’m just so thankful that we have (gotten to this point),&#8221; Mita said.</p>

<p><em>The University Scholars Program honors faculty members for superior research and teaching, along with great promise for future achievements. The award provides $15,000 a year for three years.</em></p>
<p><strong>Yolanda Suarez-Balcazar<br /></strong><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Professor, Occupational Therapy<br /></span><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Affiliate faculty, Disability and Human Development and Psychology</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Years at UIC</b>: 20</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What are your research interests?<br /></b>Throughout my career,  I have been interested in conducting research with a community-engagement and community-based participatory research approach. My areas of research focus on understanding and addressing health disparities experienced by Latinx with disabilities and their families. I have been identifying the social determinants of health that impact Latinx families of children with disabilities and designing, along with families, culturally relevant interventions to promote healthy lifestyles and health equity. My work has also focused on promoting cultural humility, diversity, equity and inclusion. I am currently involved on a federally funded project in which we are designing a “promotoras” (community health workers) intervention to support the health and well-being of Latina mothers of children with disabilities. I am also involved on two other projects designed to promote health literacy and cultural humility among health care providers and community health workers.  </p>
<p class="p1"><b>How did you become interested in these topics? <br /></b>I became interested in these areas back when I was growing up in Bogota, Colombia, in a large family of 12 kids. My family was involved in several community efforts to support low-income families and street children. While a graduate student at the University of Kansas, I was exposed to independent living and community participation research in collaboration with the disability community. Since moving to Chicago, I realized that Latinx immigrant families of children with disabilities in general have little access to resources, tend to have poor health status and often lack knowledge of their rights. Besides, obesity and health concerns are prevalent in the Latinx community with disability. <b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>What do you teach? <br /></b>I currently teach a graduate seminar on Race, Culture and Health Disparities, and another elective on Program Evaluation. I created both courses as I saw the need based on students’ feedback and neither course was being offered in the college. I also teach some of the diversity, equity and inclusion content to our entry-level occupational therapy students. This includes a workshop on cultural humility and implicit bias. </p>
<p class="p1"><b>How do you balance teaching and research? <br /></b>About balancing my teaching and research, my department fosters synergies between our research, teaching and service endeavors. My research focuses on issues of race, culture and health disparities as well as designing, implementing and evaluating culturally relevant interventions. I embed my research into my teaching and the teaching helps me keep up with the literature in these areas, optimizing both activities, and allows me to work closely with students interested in these topics. I truly enjoy working with and mentoring students.<b></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>What’s your advice to students who want to focus their future careers on research?<br /></b></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Focus on areas that you are passionate about. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Engage with communities to learn from them what matters most. We might bring knowledge of theories, methods, concepts and evidence of best practices, but we need to collaborate with community members to learn from them what matters most and how they are addressing the issues that matter to them on a daily basis. See knowledge creation as a close collaboration between academia and communities of interest. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Volunteer in the community and get involved. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Explore other ways of thinking, seeing and doing outside of the Western world. Critically think about ways to become a champion of justice, diversity, equity and inclusion.  </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Be humble and ask critical questions. It is OK not to know all the answers. Think of research as opportunities to engage with communities to find those answers regarding pressing social and health issues facing the work today. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Have an open mind to explore new ways, be global and become an agent of change.</span></li>
