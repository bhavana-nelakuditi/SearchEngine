					<description><![CDATA[Beth Richie receives $250,000 for work cultivating and nurturing movements for justice and freedom]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>University of Illinois Chicago professor Beth Richie is among a select group of 10 progressive academics to be named to the latest cohort of the Marguerite Casey Foundation’s<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.caseygrants.org/freedom-scholars">Freedom Scholars</a>, a<strong> </strong>group of scholars leading research and engaged in organizing that advances a racial and economic justice agenda.</p>

<p>Now in its third year, the Freedom Scholars honor provides a one-time award of $250,000 to each recipient to support their work.</p>



<p>Richie, UIC professor and head of criminology, law and justice and professor of Black studies, has conducted four decades of scholarly and activist work focused on the ways that race, ethnicity and social position affect the experience of violence and criminalization, particularly the experiences of Black women and gender non-conforming people. She discusses the importance of ideas and their impact on culture in a <a href="https://www.caseygrants.org/2022-freedom-scholars/beth-e-richie-phd">video</a> from the foundation.</p>



<p>Her current work is at the nexus of race, criminalization and gender violence. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am working on projects in support of criminalized survivors — women and other people who have experienced physical, sexual, and emotional harm from individuals, community institutions and state agencies who are then punished for their attempts to resist or protect themselves,” she said. “This work includes a new research project that documents the extent and nature of the incarceration of survivors of violence and activist work on grassroots campaigns to free people from the long reach of the criminal legal system.”</p>



<p>Richie also teaches at Stateville Correctional Center and is leading an effort to begin an educational program at Logan Correctional Facility. She is the convener of the UIC Abolition Teaching and Learning Network, a group of faculty, students and staff who are working on campus to ensure that incarcerated and formerly incarcerated students have the benefit of a college education and that the campus is accessible to those impacted by mass criminalization.</p>



<p>All of this work is guided by a commitment to abolition feminism and anti-racist strategies for justice, where harm is addressed without the violence of the carceral state, said Richie, who has been at UIC since 1997.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The recognition as a Freedom Scholar will advance that work, building institutional capacity on campus, expanding access to legal and educational services in prisons, challenging patriarchal and racist policies that harm survivors, creating transformative justice and community-based solutions to gender violence and building a world where freedom and justice prevail,” she said.</p>



<p>Her latest publication, “Abolition. Feminism. Now.,” a book she co-authored with Angela Y. Davis, Gina Dent and Erica Meiners, was published earlier this year.&nbsp; Among her other published works is “Arrested Justice: Black Women, Violence and America’s Prison Nation,” which chronicles the evolution of the contemporary anti-violence movement during the time of mass incarceration in the United States. Her book “Compelled to Crime: The Gender Entrapment of Black Battered Women” is taught in college classrooms and is cited in the popular press for its original arguments concerning race, gender and crime.</p>



<p>Richie’s work has been supported by grants from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the National Institute for Justice and the National Institute of Corrections.</p>



<p>Richie’s previous honors include the Audre Lorde Legacy Award from the Union Institute, The Advocacy Award from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, The Visionary Award from the Violence Intervention Project and the UIC Woman of the Year Award. Next year, she will be designated as a UIC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences distinguished professor.</p>



<p>She is the second UIC scholar to earn the Freedom Scholar honor. In 2020, UIC historian Barbara Ransby was among the inaugural recipients of the award, which was established to enhance the financial resources available to scholars leading abolitionist, Black, feminist, queer, radical and anti-colonialist studies.</p>



<p>“Through their research, these scholars provide critical insight to social justice leaders and encourage all of us to radically reimagine a democracy, economy and society animated by liberation,” Carmen Rojas, president and CEO of the Marguerite Casey Foundation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Paper published in the American Chemical Society's journal Nano Letters]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new study involving researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago achieved a milestone in the synthesis of multifunctional photonic nanomaterials.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c03563">paper published in the American Chemical Society&#8217;s journal Nano Letters</a>, they report the synthesis of semiconductor “giant” core-shell quantum dots with record-breaking emissive lifetimes. In addition, the lifetimes can be tuned by making a simple alteration to the material’s internal structure.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

(A) TEM analyses reveal a zinc selenide-rich core interior and a cadmium sulfide shell exterior. (B) Time resolved emission reveals lifetime tunability by simple alterations to the QD structure. The lifetimes can be 10-times greater compared with similar materials.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The group, which included collaborators from Princeton University and Pennsylvania State University, demonstrated a new structure-property concept that imparts the ability to spatially localize electrons or holes within a core/shell heterostructure by tuning the charge carrier’s kinetic energy on a parabolic potential energy surface.</p>



<p>According to UIC chemist Preston Snee, this charge carrier separation results in extended radiative lifetimes and in continuous emission at the single-nanoparticle level.</p>



<p>“These properties enable new applications for optics, facilitate novel approaches such as time-gated single-particle imaging and create inroads for the development of other new advanced materials,” said Snee, UIC associate professor of chemistry and the study’s senior co-author.</p>



<p>Snee and the study’s first author, Marcell Pálmai, UIC postdoctoral research associate in chemistry, teamed with Haw Yang of Princeton and others to excite the quantum dots particle with light to put it in the “exciton” state. The exciton is an electron/hole charge pair, and in the new materials, the electron becomes displaced from the center to the shell, where it becomes trapped for upwards of 500 nanoseconds, which represents the record for such nanomaterials.</p>



<p>“As emissive materials, quantum dots hold the promise of creating more energy-efficient displays and can be used as fluorescent probes for biomedical research due to their highly robust optical properties. They are 10 times to 100 times more absorptive than organic dyes and are nearly impervious to photobleaching, which is why they are used in the new Samsung QLED-TV,” they write.&nbsp;</p>

(B) Typical single-particle emission trajectory of type II CdZnSe/CdS gQDs shows no blinking behavior.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>These new particles have great efficacy for fundamental biological discovery, according to the researchers.</p>



<p>The quantum dots presented in their paper emit at red wavelengths, which minimizes scattering, while the long lifetimes allow for biological imaging to be performed with less background noise. At the single particle level, the new quantum dots emit continuously, so a research scientist can tag proteins relevant to cancer and follow the biological dynamics without losing track of the signal which is currently a common problem with such studies.</p>



<p>In future research, the group plans to demonstrate that the materials make good components for optical devices such as micron-sized lasers.</p>



<p>Additional co-authors of the paper are Marcell Pálmai, Eun Byoel Kim, Prakash Parajuli, Kyle Tomczak, Kai Wang, Bibash Sapkota, Nan Jiang and Robert F. Klie of UIC; Joseph S. Beckwith, Nyssa T. Emerson, Shuhui Yin and Tian Zhao of Princeton; and Ming Tien of Pennsylvania State University.</p>



<p>Funding from the University of Illinois Chicago primarily supported this work. The research was also supported by funding from the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund and grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DE-SC0019364), the Fonds National Suisse de la Recherche Scientifique (P2GEP2_191208) and the National Science Foundation (CHE-1944796).</p>

Romanucci will be the keynote speaker for the 2022 undergraduate ceremony. Photo provided.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The commencement speaker for the undergraduate ceremony will be Antonio M. Romanucci, a national civil rights and personal injury attorney and co-founding partner of Romanucci &amp; Blandin, LLC. Romanucci is a graduate of the former The John Marshall Law School, which was acquired by the university in 2019 and renamed the UIC School of Law.</p>



<p>Starting as a Cook County public defender, he has progressed to being one of the leading civil rights attorneys in the country. He was named the No. 1 civil rights lawyer in 2022 by Leading Lawyers and was selected as<em> </em>Chicago Lawyer magazine’s 2021 Person of the Year. Additionally, he was recently recognized by Chicago Magazine<em> </em>on their ‘New Power 30’ list for his many contributions to the Chicago community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Romanucci is considered the “architect” of the historic civil rights lawsuit and settlement against the City of Minneapolis while co-representing the estate of George Floyd. His national presence is on behalf of many who have suffered due to corporate or individual negligence and his cases include those who lost loved ones on a Boeing 737 Max aircraft, those who were made sick by ethylene oxide emissions in Willowbrook, Illinois, and victims of mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, Las Vegas and Highland Park, Illinois.</p>



<p>He is active in a number of professional associations, such as the American Association for Justice, as well as civic and charitable organizations for children, including St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, where he was honorary chair of the annual fundraising gala in Chicago in 2020.</p>



<p>Romanucci works to educate the next generation by sharing his experiences as an attorney advocating for plaintiffs and for civil justice in and out of the courtroom. He shares this message as he speaks on college campuses, to fellow lawyers, bar associations and community groups. Romanucci has been a guest lecturer to students at the UIC School of Law as well as a speaker at other UIC events, including the University’s Minority Health Conference titled “Bridging the Gap” in Fall 2022.</p>

<p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that women over the age of 65 may be undergoing unnecessary cervical cancer screenings and that more public health data is needed on the utilization of cervical cancer screening-associated services among older women to prevent potential harm and unnecessary costs.</p>



<p>The study, which is authored by experts from the University of Illinois Chicago, the University of California San Francisco and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at Medicare claims data from 1999 to 2019 for fee-for-service care for women over the age of 65.</p>



<p>The analysis showed that in 2019 more than 1.3 million women received cervical cancer screening-associated services, such as a Pap test, colposcopy and other cervical procedures, after age 65. While these services cost more than $83 million, the researchers concluded they were of “unclear clinical appropriateness.”</p>



<p>“Cervical cancer screening and other preventive services are among our most important tools for keeping people healthy throughout life, but screenings should also follow evidence-based guidelines to prevent overspending, potential complications and patient discomfort,” said study co-author Dr. Hunter Holt, assistant professor of family and community medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago.</p>



<p>“Cancer screening involves a judicious consideration of the balance between both benefits and harms. As people get older, the potential benefits decline and the potential harms increase,” said co-author Dr. George Sawaya, professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California San Francisco.</p>



<p>According to recommendations and guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, women considered to be of average risk can stop undergoing routine cervical cancer screening once they reach the age of 65 if they have had adequate prior screening.</p>



<p>“The decision to end cervical cancer screening for women after age 65 requires review of past screening results and related medical history. This process can promote cervical cancer prevention and prevent harms and costs from unnecessary tests and procedures,” said Jin Qin, study co-author and epidemiologist in CDC’s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control.</p>



<p>The researchers say that the high rates of screening among older women is potentially concerning.</p>



<p>“It could be that women are getting screened when they do not need to, or that these women are considered to be at higher-than-average risk, for example, because they have not been adequately screened prior to 65. We do not want to see either of these things and unfortunately, there is not enough public health data to shed light on the causes,” said Holt, who is also affiliated with the University of Illinois Cancer Center at UIC.</p>



<p>“In this study, about 3% of women aged over 80 years received at least one screening-related service. The Society for General Internal Medicine does not recommend cancer screening be performed in individuals with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, which corresponds to age 80 and older in the U.S., so there may well be over-screening,” Sawaya said.</p>



<p>The study showed that white women were more likely to be screened after age 65, and that Black and Latina women were more likely to undergo a diagnostic colposcopy and subsequent cervical procedures.</p>



<p>Overall, the analysis found that the percentage of women over age 65 who received at least one Pap test decreased from 19% (2.9 million women) in 1999 to 9% (1.3 million women) in 2019, a reduction of 55%. Rates of colposcopy and cervical procedures decreased 43% and 64%, respectively.</p>



<p>“While cervical cancer is a more top-of-mind concern for younger women than older women, women over the age of 65 represent about 20% of diagnoses and 36% of deaths due to cervical cancer. It is critical that we develop better data to understand how screenings are being used among this population and if screening services are being used appropriately,” Holt said.</p>



<p>Co-authors of “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2798311">Utilization Trends and Recent Expenditures for Cervical Cancer Screening-Associated Services in Medicare Fee-for-Service Beneficiaries over Age 65</a>” also include Dr. Thomas Richards and Dr. Mona Saraiya of the CDC.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Miranda joins UIC after serving as provost at Notre Dame, Rice; brings focus on access and equity]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Marie Lynn Miranda, the former provost of the University of Notre Dame and a leader in the drive to make higher education more inclusive, has been named chancellor of the University of Illinois Chicago and a vice president of the University of Illinois System.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/20221111_uicchancellorwelcomeevent_mf_0445-1/"><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="393" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-590x393.jpg" alt="Marie Lynn Miranda" class="wp-image-138936" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-590x393.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-387x258.jpg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1-1320x880.jpg 1320w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221111_UICChancellorWelcomeEvent_MF_0445-1.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a><figcaption>Marie Lynn Miranda will take office July 5, 2023, as the 10th chancellor of UIC.

<p>Pending formal approval by the Board of Trustees at its Nov. 17 meeting, Miranda will take office July 5, 2023, as the 10th chancellor of UIC. She will succeed Chancellor Michael Amiridis, who became President of the University of South Carolina in June.</p>



<p>Miranda, 59, served as provost at Notre Dame through 2021 and remains a member of the faculty in its Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics. As provost, she led the private university’s academic response to the COVID-19 pandemic; helped drive efforts to increase faculty and student diversity, resulting in the most diverse first-year class in school history in 2021; started a transformational leaders program to provide resources to students from under-served backgrounds; and led a bottom up strategic planning process that engaged more than 600 members of the faculty.</p>



<p>Miranda brings a wide range of other leadership experience at Rice University, the University of Michigan and Duke University to her new role as chancellor of UIC and its nearly 34,000 students and 13,000 faculty and staff.</p>



<p>“It is an honor to be chosen to lead one of the country’s great urban universities and to serve this global city and its people,” Miranda said. “I look forward to learning from and working with students, faculty and staff as we work collaboratively with our community partners to meet the pressing challenges and opportunities before us. Together we can provide life-changing educational programs at scale, while fostering the world-class research and engagement our city, state, country and world need.”</p>



<p>University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen said Miranda’s deep experience as a higher education innovator dedicated to access, excellence and community engagement will serve UIC well.</p>



<p>“Marie Lynn comes to UIC and the University of Illinois System as a champion for higher education, a believer in the undisputable impact that a great university can have on the lives of its students, their families and the communities it serves,” Killeen said. “She has been a leader in making certain that higher education is accessible to more and more people, a public good that should be available to students from all backgrounds and income levels. I look forward to working with her to advance UIC and the U of I System.”</p>



<p>At Notre Dame, Miranda is also director of the Children&#8217;s Environmental Health Initiative (CEHI), a research, education and outreach organization committed to fostering environments where all people can prosper. The initiative is best known for its work on childhood lead exposure – contributing to the CDC’s decision to set a more protective standard for childhood blood lead levels, developing strategies for combatting lead in drinking water, and identifying lead in aviation gasoline as a contributor to elevated blood lead levels. CEHI’s most recent work focuses on racial residential segregation and the ways segregated neighborhoods experience greater exposure to social and environmental stressors, which in turn drives health and educational disparities.</p>



<p>Before joining Notre Dame in 2020, Miranda was provost at Rice University from 2015-19. She was responsible for all aspects of the university’s academic, research, scholarly and creative programs, supported by a roughly $700 million annual budget. While at Rice, Miranda also led planning and implementation of $230 million in investments focused on areas such as molecular nanotechnology, data sciences, neuroengineering, inequities and inequalities and general research competitiveness. Her efforts at Rice also included providing a comprehensive set of programs for students from under-served backgrounds – an initiative which substantially closed graduation and time to degree gaps.</p>



<p>At Michigan, Miranda was dean of what was then the School of Natural Resources and Environment from 2012-15, restructuring the doctoral program and improving degree-completion metrics; developing data systems to support evidence-based decision-making in admissions and advising; and reinvigorating the department’s alumni relations operation.</p>



<p>Prior to her work at Michigan, Miranda spent 21 years as a member of the faculty at Duke University, including nine years as director of undergraduate programs for the Nicholas School of the Environment. She also was principal investigator of a research laboratory with roughly 30 full-time staff and 40-plus faculty collaborators. Over the course of her research career, Miranda has been principal investigator or co-principal investigator on over $75 million dollars in research funding.</p>



<p>She is a Phi Beta Kappa, <em>summa cum laude</em> graduate of Duke University, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and economics and was named a Truman Scholar. She has a PhD and Master of Arts from Harvard University, where she held a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.</p>



<p>Miranda is also a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>



<p>She was chosen from five finalists and a pool of 40 well-qualified applicants. A committee chaired by UIC Interim Provost and Professor Karen Colley advised system Executive Vice President Avijit Ghosh and Killeen in the search.</p>

<p>A senior thesis focusing on the homeless community in Chicago by a recent University of Illinois Chicago graduate from the College of Architecture, Design and the Arts has won an award in the Global Design Graduate Show 2022 competition.</p>

<p>Xavier Pacheco, who graduated in May with a bachelor’s degree in industrial design from the School of Design and a minor in psychology, earned the award in the service design category.</p>



<p>He was one of nearly 5,500 students to enter the show, which is in its third year and is run by Arts Thread, a digital platform for emerging artists, in collaboration with the luxury brand Gucci. There were almost 400 art and design schools represented from around the world.</p>



<p>Pacheco’s project, “<a href="https://www.artsthread.com/events/globaldesigngraduateshow/product-architecture-interiors#/project/addressing-the-homeless-community-of-chicago">Addressing the Homeless Community of Chicago</a>,” asks a powerful question: “In a city that takes pride in the close-knit nature of its communities, why is it that the homeless community is largely overlooked by its citizens?”</p>



<p>What started as an idea when he first encountered a homeless encampment near the UIC campus during his sophomore year, was developed and crafted by Pacheco for his thesis over several years of design studies.</p>

<p>“The senior thesis is a representation of who we are as a designer, so I wanted to use this opportunity to really address something that I personally held close to my heart,” said Pacheco, who is originally from Aurora but now lives in Chicago.</p>



<p>Pacheco said that as a city of 2.7 million people, Chicago’s tight-knit communities serve to provide the benefits of what the city has to offer. While the communities are developed to grow together, Pacheco asks about those who are left out.</p>



<p>“I wanted to ask the question, ‘Why is it we as a society inhumanly treat and do not provide the same amount of support for one particular community?” Pacheco said. “The homeless community in Chicago is a close-knit community of individuals who are constantly among us. As a society we don’t even acknowledge that these individuals exist.”</p>



<p>He said he was disturbed by how it has become a social norm to ignore the homeless as they try to interact and ask for anything that would help them. Society instead allows itself to be fueled by the misconception that the homeless are somehow responsible for their plight, due to substance abuse or laziness, Pacheco said.</p>

<p>His project fills the need for public service messaging that targets the homeless to assist them in finding the help they need, he said. In response, he created “AllY” a user-centered support system designed for Chicago&#8217;s homeless community. The system provides information about nearby resources through infographic support maps and connects them to service locations via the Chicago Transit Authority, he said. AllY cards with information about services would also be distributed and shared among the community.</p>



<p>“AllY puts an ally on the streets of Chicago to assist homeless individuals in getting back to where they want to be,” Pacheco said. “I felt that we finally must address this issue and alter the stigma that infects our society’s perspectives toward the homeless community.”</p>



<p>He conducted community surveys on the UIC campus with students and faculty about their interactions with the homeless community. He also interviewed professionals who directly work with the homeless population to tap into their years of experience. In total, he interviewed 185 participants.</p>



<p>After the surveys were conducted, he used the insights he had gleaned to create the support system. He later had the opportunity to speak with an alderperson to share his proposal with the city.</p>



<p>After graduating from UIC, Pacheco began working with Deloitte as a design analyst within its applied design team.</p>



<p>“Chicago’s my home so I wanted to do something that could directly impact where I live,” he said.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/?attachment_id=138297"><img loading="lazy" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Polikanov-Syroegin-590x329.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-138297" width="590" height="329" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Polikanov-Syroegin-590x329.jpeg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Polikanov-Syroegin-390x217.jpeg 390w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Polikanov-Syroegin-768x428.jpeg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Polikanov-Syroegin-1536x856.jpeg 1536w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Polikanov-Syroegin-2048x1142.jpeg 2048w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Polikanov-Syroegin-500x279.jpeg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Polikanov-Syroegin-1000x558.jpeg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Polikanov-Syroegin-1320x736.jpeg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a><figcaption>Illustration showing the principle of native chemical ligation approach developed by Syroegin, et al. Addition of the cysteine amino acid (red) to tRNA (blue, top left) allows for the tRNA to fuse to a peptide (yellow, lower left). The resulting ribosome structure (middle) and the captured electron density maps for the peptidyl-tRNA inside the ribosome (right) were obtained by X-ray crystallography in the UIC experiments. (Image: Syroegin, et al.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Inside tiny cellular machines called ribosomes, chains of genetic material called messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are matched with the corresponding transfer RNAs (tRNAs) to create sequences of amino acids that exit the ribosome as proteins. Unfinished proteins are called nascent chainsm and they are left attached to the ribosome. </p>



<p>Scientists know that some of these nascent chains can regulate the activity of the ribosome and that the nascent chains can sometimes interfere with antibiotics — many of which work by targeting bacterial ribosome activity. Scientists do not know why this happens, mainly because it is hard to visualize what the ribosome-peptide-drug interactions look like while the unfinished proteins are still tethered to the ribosome. </p>



<p>Now, scientists at the University of Illinois Chicago are the first to report a method for stable attachment of peptides to tRNAs, which has allowed them to gain new fundamental insights into ribosome function by determining the atomic-level structures of ribosomes and the shapes that these peptides take inside the ribosome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their method is newly reported in the journal Nature Chemistry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The challenge has been to see up close the structure of the ribosome and the exit tunnel in the presence of the nascent peptides because, in nature, the ribosome is very quick for us to capture images or conduct experiments,” said Yury Polikanov, associate professor in the biological sciences department at the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. “Until the advent of this new method, we’ve essentially been blinded from seeing what is happening in the active site of the ribosome at this critical moment in time.” </p>



<p>Polikanov and his colleague Egor Syroegin, a PhD candidate in biological sciences at UIC, used a method called native chemical ligation to fuse custom peptides with the tRNA to yield what is called a peptidyl-tRNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Obtaining tRNA molecules linked to peptides, similar to those inside the ribosome during protein synthesis, has remained a dream of many researchers in the field for almost two decades,&#8221; Polikanov said. &#8220;This has been extremely challenging because there are no enzymes that can directly attach peptides to a tRNA.&#8221;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/?attachment_id=138327"><img loading="lazy" width="305" height="406" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Polikanov-Group-305x406.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-138327" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Polikanov-Group-305x406.jpeg 305w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Polikanov-Group-194x258.jpeg 194w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Polikanov-Group-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Polikanov-Group-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Polikanov-Group-500x667.jpeg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Polikanov-Group-1000x1333.jpeg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Polikanov-Group-1320x1760.jpeg 1320w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Polikanov-Group.jpeg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></a><figcaption>Yury Polikanov, Elena Aleksandrova and Egor Syroegin are co-authors of “Insights into the ribosome function from the structures of non-arrested ribosome nascent chain complexes,” in Nature Chemistry. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“The method has been used for a long time in chemistry, but it has never been applied in this way. It&#8217;s mimicking nature, basically, and with our advanced imaging experience, we are now seeing how nature works at a high resolution,” Syroegin said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this new approach, Polikanov and Syroegin determined a set of high-resolution structures of the ribosome carrying peptidyl-tRNAs of various lengths.</p>



<p>Detailed analysis of these structures provides new and surprising insights into the mechanism of the ribosome’s catalytic center and answered several long-standing fundamental questions in the ribosome field, Polikanov said.  </p>



<p>“We saw that depending on the sequence, different peptides can form different shapes or folds within the ribosomal tunnel, and we can synthesize different peptides of different sequences and then follow their shape very precisely, because of the high resolution of our structures,” Syroegin said. “So now, we can very confidently say that ‘these peptides, of this sequence, have this shape’ or ‘another peptide has another shape.’ That’s important because nascent peptide folding determines whether drugs would arrest ribosome or not.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This method opens countless avenues for structural and functional studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of ribosome functioning, as well as sequence-specific ribosome stalling induced by certain antibiotics,” Polikanov said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polikanov and Syroegin are co-authors of the paper, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-022-01073-1" target="_blank">Insights into the ribosome function from the structures of non-arrested ribosome nascent chain complexes</a>,” along with Elena Aleksandrova, research specialist in the biological sciences department at UIC. </p>



<p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01-GM132302, R21-AI163466), the National Science Foundation (MCB-1907273) and Illinois State startup funds. This work is based upon research conducted at the Northeastern Collaborative Access Team beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (DE-AC02-06CH11357).&nbsp;</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Health disparities like these have prompted the Health Resources and Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to award the University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health $1.5 million in scholarship funds from the American Rescue Plan.

<p><span data-contrast="none">UIC is one of 29 institutions nationwide and the only institution in Illinois to secure a grant from the funds. UIC’s program will provide scholarships for in-state students who are committed to serving medically underserved communities throughout Illinois, with preference for those who come from traditionally underrepresented groups, specifically Black, Hispanic, Native American or tribal, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander students. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“Over </span><span data-contrast="auto">the last 10 to 15 years, there has been a huge amount of attrition in the public health workforce, and COVID really illustrated the importance of having a strong public health workforce,” UIC School of Public Health Dean Dr. Wayne Giles said. “Our intent is to provide a more diverse workforce that will help to get communities focused on the importance and value of prevention, provide more access to care, and implement policies to promote health and well-being, so that all people can achieve their optimal health.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Prior to the grant award, 34% of the school’s </span><span data-contrast="auto">in-state <span data-contrast="none">Master of Public Health</span> students were Black or Latino</span><span data-contrast="none">, and nearly 35% of all program graduates took jobs in medically underserved communities upon degree completion.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">School of Public Health Assistant Dean John Slavick helped prepare the proposal for the grant, along with Senior Associate Dean Jamie Chriqui, who led the effort, and Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion Nadine Peacock. </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Slavick believes UIC’s track record in educating underrepresented students and providing health workers for underserved communities played a role in distinguishing the university’s application for the grant, for which UIC received the maximum amount available from HRSA.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“We have a long history of people working in these communities, and we have good connections with the public health departments and alumni, whom we can engage for mentorship and as preceptors for internship programs for these students</span>,&#8221; Slavick said.</p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">School leadership credits the award in part to longstanding partnerships with the Chicago Department of Public Health and the Illinois Department of Public Health, along with letters of support from the Cook County Department of Public Health, the Kane County Health Department, the Lake County Health Department, the Illinois Public Health Institute, the Illinois Public Health Association, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors, all of whom attested to their interest in engaging the scholarship students for their required practicum training as well as long-term employment.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The majority of the 57 scholarships will cover full tuition and fees for recipients, with a portion of the funds set aside for nontraditional students the program calls life scholars. These are community-funded workers who were trained by UIC during the height of the pandemic to do contact tracing and connect vulnerable individuals with services. </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“This is an amazing cohort of people who may have been underemployed and now have a passion for public health and want to get back to school,” Peacock said.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The students who receive the new scholarships will receive additional academic support to help them transition to the master’s program and will be enrolled in a special public health leadership course. They also will be encouraged to take core courses in emergency preparedness, health disparities, public health geographic information systems and other topics that will prepare them&nbsp;to become immediate contributors in different public health roles. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“Our goal is to really prepare them with not just the formal public health training, but also the soft skills that we&#8217;ve heard from our Partner Advisory Board are so critical for students coming out of public health programs and going into the workforce, including leadership and management training and strong communications skills,” Chriqui said.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Public health workers serve communities in a variety of ways, educating residents on the fundamentals of health, diet and hygiene; connecting individuals with health care providers; advocating for community needs; and offering basic health services like vaccinations or wellness visits. They may also help to shape public policy, work as epidemiologists or biostatisticians, lead sanitation processes or determine how environmental issues impact community health.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Intermittent fasting has been shown to be an effective way to lose weight, but critics have worried that the practice may have a negative impact on women’s reproductive hormones. Now, a team of University of Illinois Chicago researchers has published a study in&nbsp;Obesity&nbsp;that brings new evidence to the table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers,&nbsp;led by Krista Varady,&nbsp;UIC professor of nutrition, followed a group of pre- and post-menopausal obese women for a period of eight weeks on the “warrior diet” method of intermittent fasting.</p>



<p>The warrior diet prescribes a time-restricted feeding window of four hours per day, during which dieters can eat without counting calories before resuming a water fast until the next day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They measured the differences in hormone levels, obtained by analyzing blood sample data, in groups of dieters who stuck to four- and six-hour feeding windows against a control group that followed no diet restrictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Varady and her team found that levels of sex-binding globulin hormone, a protein that carries reproductive hormones throughout the body, was unchanged in the dieters after eight weeks. The same held true for both testosterone and androstenedione, a steroid hormone that the body uses to produce both testosterone and estrogen.</p>



<p>However, dehydroepiandrosterone or DHEA, a hormone that fertility clinics prescribe to improve ovarian function and egg quality, was significantly lower in both pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women at the end of the trial, dropping by about 14%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the drop in DHEA levels was the most significant finding of the study, in both pre- and post-menopausal women, DHEA levels remained within the normal range by the end of the eight-week period.</p>



<p>“This suggests that in pre-menopausal women, the minor drop in DHEA levels has to be weighed against the proven fertility benefits of lower body mass,” Varady said. “The drop in DHEA levels in post-menopausal women could be concerning because menopause already causes a dramatic drop in estrogen, and DHEA is a primary component of estrogen. However, a survey of the participants reported no negative side effects associated with low estrogen post-menopause, such as sexual dysfunction or skin changes.“</p>



<p>As an added benefit, since high DHEA has been linked to breast cancer risk, Varady said a moderate drop in levels might be helpful in reducing that risk for both pre- and post-menopausal women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study measured levels of estradiol, estrone and progesterone — all hormones vital to pregnancy — as well, but only in post-menopausal women, due to the changing levels of these hormones throughout pre-menopausal women’s menstrual cycles.&nbsp;Among post-menopausal women, there was no change in these hormones at the end of eight weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Women in both the four-hour and six-hour dieting groups experienced weight loss of 3% to 4% of their baseline weight throughout the course of the study, compared with the control group, which had almost no weight loss. The dieters also saw a drop in insulin resistance and in biomarkers of oxidative stress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perimenopausal women, who are typically in their 40s, were excluded from the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, Varady said, “I think this is a great first step. We’ve observed thousands of pre- and post-menopausal women through different alternate-day fasting and time-restricted eating strategies. All it’s doing is making people eat less. By shortening that eating window, you’re just naturally cutting calories.&nbsp;Much of the negative information on intermittent fasting reported has come from studies on mice or rats. We need more studies to look at the effects of intermittent fasting on humans.”</p>



<p>The study, &#8220;<a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1002%2Foby.23562&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cjmcarey%40uic.edu%7C81a5b3d068eb432fb75b08dab2db672a%7Ce202cd477a564baa99e3e3b71a7c77dd%7C0%7C0%7C638018952646202776%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=1YlqKsWrrP4rftBhuwV5LJghq%2FG1lMdkHEOVgeJ3hnc%3D&amp;reserved=0">Effect of time-restricted eating on sex hormone levels in premenopausal and postmenopausal females</a>&#8221; was supported by a grant (R01DK119783) from the National Institutes of Health.</p>



<p>Co-authors of the study are Faiza Kalam, Rand Akasheh, Sofia Cienfuegos, Aparna Ankireddy, Kelsey Gabel, Mark Ezpeleta, Shuhao Lin, Chandra Tamatam, Sekhar Reddy, Bonnie Spring and Seema Khan.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="normaltextrun">Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago have found a small molecule capable of manipulating an immune process that plays an important role in cancers and autoimmune diseases.</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span class="normaltextrun">Their discovery is reported in an Angewandte Chemie paper titled “</span><a rel="noopener" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/anie.202203560" target="_blank"><span class="normaltextrun">Discovery of the First Selective Nanomolar Inhibitors of ERAP2 by Kinetic Target-Guided Synthesis</span></a><span class="normaltextrun">.”</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span class="normaltextrun">They discovered the molecule — and enzyme inhibitor — after first studying how the immune system works and why some diseases can be resistant to treatments.</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span class="normaltextrun">“Tumors have the ability to present cell-surface markers in the form of non-self peptide antigens, or neoantigens, which renders them exquisitely sensitive to recognition and elimination by T-cells, a form of immune cells that kill tumor cells upon recognition of neoantigens,” said study corresponding author Marlene Bouvier, UIC professor of microbiology and immunology at the College of Medicine. “The visibility of a tumor to T-cells is therefore a critical aspect of whether a T-cell based immunotherapy treatment will be successful. Unfortunately, most tumors have low expression levels of neoantigens on their surfaces and, consequently, are resistant to immunotherapies.”</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/?attachment_id=137854"><img loading="lazy" width="314" height="258" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/anie202203560-fig-0001-m-314x258.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-137854" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/anie202203560-fig-0001-m-314x258.jpg 314w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/anie202203560-fig-0001-m-493x406.jpg 493w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/anie202203560-fig-0001-m-768x632.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/anie202203560-fig-0001-m-500x411.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/anie202203560-fig-0001-m.jpg 915w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></a><figcaption>Illustration of the function of ERAP2 in antigen trimming leading to either epitope destruction or generation.

<p><span class="normaltextrun">For the study, the team looked at endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases 1 and 2, or ERAP1 and ERAP2, which are proteins responsible for trimming and over-trimming peptide antigens and neoantigens inside cells. </span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span class="normaltextrun">“Over-trimming of neoantigens in tumors by ERAPs represents missed opportunities to ‘illuminate’ tumors for recognition and destruction by T-cells,” Bouvier said. “As such, the modulation of ERAP1 and ERAP2 function with small molecule inhibitors offers an exciting approach to tone down their over-trimming function, increase tumor visibility, and enhance immune responses against tumors.”</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span class="normaltextrun">In their study, the UIC team describes the discovery of the first highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of ERAP2.</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span class="normaltextrun">“We used kinetic target-guided synthesis to discover such inhibitors,” Bouvier said. “We then used X-ray crystallography to reveal at the atomic level the binding mode of the small molecules, which allowed us to improve their design for greater potency and selectivity. We also showed that some optimized analogues represent lead compounds for drug discovery efforts.” </span><span class="eop"> </span></p>

<p>The University of Illinois Chicago is one of six institutions that will split an $8.8 million National Science Foundation grant to develop theories, research methods and tools to help expand and tailor the field of STEM education to support Black students.</p>



<p>The five-year project will be led by Terrell Morton, UIC assistant professor of identity and justice in STEM education. He will serve as the principal investigator for the overall project and for UIC specifically. Other universities involved in the effort include Tennessee State University, the University of Texas at Austin, American University, Georgia State University and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.</p>



<p>The title of the project is, “Collaborative Research: EHR Racial Equity: Examining Blackness in Postsecondary STEM Education through a Multidimensional-Multiplicative Lens.”</p>



<p>Morton, who is in the department of educational psychology in the College of Education, said that while there is a lot of desire to foster racial equity, particularly at the policy level in STEM education, the assumption is often that every Black person is homogeneous, simply because of their shared racial identity.</p>



<p>“We assume that every Black person needs the exact same thing because of their racial identity as Black,” Morton said. “The purpose of this project is to say that not every Black person is the same, even if they all racially identify as Black.”</p>



<p>The goal is to develop and tailor racial equity-focused policies and practices in STEM education and to facilitate increased access and sustained engagement in STEM for Black undergraduate students. This includes looking at what “Blackness means for individuals,” Morton said.</p>



<p>Morton points to contemporary literature that suggests that the embodiment of “Blackness” differs according to many dimensions, including ethnic identity, where people grew up and if they are the first in their family to attend college, how far back their ancestry is traced in the U.S. and other factors.</p>



<p>“As a result of these different identity factors in addition to our gender identity, sexuality, religion and other salient identities we may understand the world differently,” he said. “If we want to create policies in STEM education that are equitable and pay attention to how people see the world, we need to create new tools and theories and outcomes.”</p>



<p>The schools involved in the project are purposely diverse and include two historically Black colleges and universities, two predominantly white institutions, one majority Black institution and one Hispanic-Serving Institution. They are also located in geographically distinct areas, including the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Southwest and Midwest regions, to gain a broader representation to analyze.</p>



<p>Each of the schools will serve as its own research site but will share protocols, recruitment practices and perspectives. Each of the institutions will implement the protocols in their regions. For example, Morton will be tasked with taking the created protocols and instruments and implementing them in the Chicago region through the recruitment of Black undergraduate students at four-year universities in the Chicago area who will share how they understand their identity as Black within STEM.  Eventually, a national survey would be created and analyzed.</p>



<p>“This project will produce tools of analysis and translational products that will change how institutional and organizational policies, practices and future research treat Black people in STEM, thereby promoting tailored resources and supports to meet Black people’s nuanced needs,” according to the grant.</p>



<p>The funding comes from the NSF’s Racial Equity in STEM Education program. The program supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of STEM education and workforce.</p>



<p>“This program aligns with NSF’s core value of supporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the nation’s diversity of demographic groups, regions and types of organizations,” according to NSF officials.</p>



<p>Morton is a scholar-activist whose research focuses on identity expression in STEM education for marginalized groups. Morton began at UIC in August and has experience as a co-founder of the nonprofit Christine W. Avery Learning Center in Asheville, North Carolina. Prior to UIC, he was an assistant professor of identity and justice in STEM education from the University of Missouri-Columbia.</p>



<p>He earned his doctorate in education – learning sciences and psychological studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and his Master of Science in neurobiology and neurosciences from the University of Miami. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Chemistry degree at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.</p>



<p>Other partners involved in the project include, Andrea Tyler at Tennessee State University; Tia Madkins and Yasmiyn Irizzary at the University of Texas at Austin; Shari Watkins and Brian McGowan at American University; Nickolaus Ortiz at Georgia State University and Paula Groves Price at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. Additionally, Ashley Woodson at Albion College; Jennifer Adams at the University of Calgary; Whitney McCoy at Duke University and ReAnna Roby at Vanderbilt University play critical roles in the design and execution of this project.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Second straight year UIC honored for commitment to the U.S. flagship international educational exchange program]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago has been named a Fulbright Hispanic-Serving Institution Leader for the second year in a row by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.</p>



<p>UIC and 42 other HSIs were conferred Fulbright HSI Leader status for demonstrating noteworthy engagement with Fulbright exchange participants during the 2021-2022 academic year and campus promotion of opportunities offered by the <a href="http://eca.state.gov/fulbright">Fulbright Program</a>, the U.S. government&#8217;s flagship international academic exchange program.</p>



<p>The leaders were announced this week during an international plenary session at the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities’ annual conference.</p>



<p>“The Fulbright Program offers a tremendous opportunity to internationalize students — undergraduate and graduate — and faculty while building global networks. We are proud, once again, to earn this important national recognition for our international exchange commitment,” UIC Interim Chancellor Javier Reyes said. “UIC students and faculty, as well as visiting students and scholars, are supported by staff whose dedicated efforts to recruit, advise and provide resources are all focused on their success in these impactful programs.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>The Fulbright U.S. Student Program is administered at UIC by Kim Germain, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research and External Fellowships and Fulbright Program adviser for undergraduate students and alumni, and Benn Williams, fellowships and awards coordinator in the Graduate College and Fulbright Program adviser for graduate and professional students. They are assisted by Lindsay Marshall, a writing specialist and academic adviser in the Graduate College.</p>



<p>Shawn Conner-Rondot, director of international affairs and outreach in the Office of Global Engagement, is the UIC contact for the Fulbright Scholar Program (visiting foreign students and non-U.S. scholars) and is also a liaison to the Fulbright Program for U.S. Scholars (UIC faculty). Working with Melissa Hickok and Ben Wright in the Office of International Services, Williams is also the unofficial liaison for the Foreign Student Program.</p>



<p>The Fulbright HSI Leaders initiative was established in 2021 to recognize the strong partnerships between the Fulbright Program and selected HSIs, and to encourage all HSIs to increase engagement with Fulbright. It is part of the State Department’s longstanding commitment to building diversity and inclusion within the Fulbright Program and the bureau’s international exchange programs.</p>



<p>Speaking on behalf of ECA, which sponsors the Fulbright Program, Ethan Rosenzweig, deputy assistant secretary of state for academic programs, noted the strong relationship between HSIs and the Fulbright Program.</p>



<p>“The Fulbright Program’s success with HSIs is built on real collaboration with you and your institutions,” he said.</p>



<p>Since its inception over 75 years ago, the Fulbright Program has given over 400,000 talented and accomplished students, scholars, teachers, artists and professionals of all backgrounds and fields the opportunity to study, teach, and conduct research abroad, exchange ideas, and contribute to finding solutions to complex international challenges.</p>



<p>Each year, the U.S. Congress appropriates funds for the U.S. Department of State to sponsor the Fulbright Program. Many foreign governments contribute substantially as well. Additional funding and in-kind funding is provided by U.S. and foreign host institutions, non-governmental organizations, private organizations, corporate partnerships and individual donors.</p>

<p>For the first time this fall, University of Illinois Chicago students can major in and earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in global Asian studies in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The program engages in an interdisciplinary study of Asia and transoceanic and transnational Asian diasporas and is the first of its kind in the Midwest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of the GLAS program is a better understanding of the globalized world and to redress some of the shortcomings of a limited focus on either area studies (Asian studies) or ethnic studies (Asian American studies) alone.</p>



<p>Global Asian studies also includes a study of new immigration patterns and historical shifts in the U.S. and globally. These include an emphasis on anti-Asian, anti-Black and anti-Arab/Muslim racism.</p>



<p>The idea for the program began more than 30 years ago when students pushed UIC to offer more courses related to Asian American issues and more representation on campus.</p>



<p>Since 2010, UIC has received Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions grants from the U.S. Department of Education’s Minority-Serving Institutions program. AANAPISI grants have helped support the growth of GLAS. Currently, 21% of UIC&#8217;s overall student population is Asian.</p>



<p>A celebration and panel discussion, “GLAS Major Takes (F)light: Paying Tribute to a 30-Year Movement,” involving alumni and community members will be held Oct. 7, 4-6 p.m., in the Cardinal Room, Student Center East, 750 S. Halsted St.</p>



<p>Anna Guevarra, the founding director of GLAS and a co-principal investigator of the UIC AANAPISI Initiative at UIC, will lead the discussion. </p>



<p>She recently spoke to UIC today about the program and her work.</p>



<h4><strong>Can you discuss the major and the thinking behind its development as an independent major?</strong></h4>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://glas.uic.edu/academics/glas-major-and-minor/">BA in global Asian studies</a>&nbsp;provides students with an interdisciplinary perspective on the study of Asia and transoceanic and transnational diasporas. The major draws from the humanities, social sciences and the arts and prepares students for a critical analysis of Asian and Asian American history, politics, economy and culture with a curriculum anchored by intersectional social justice frameworks. It is the first degree-granting program in Illinois that uniquely offers curricular content that draws from Asian studies and Asian American studies.</p>



<h4><strong>How does the major fit in the Global Asian Studies Program?</strong></h4>



<p>The Global Asian Studies Program developed following a merger of Asian American studies and Asian studies with the intellectual and pedagogical mission of addressing our social worlds and dissolving the artificial boundaries between these two fields. The major provides a curricular arm for understanding these dynamics and prepares students to engage and critically understand the globalized world in which we live. This also includes a study of new immigration patterns and historical shifts in U.S. and global racial formations, such as Islamophobia and anti-Arab/Muslim racism, among other issues.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Can you discuss the history leading to the new major?</strong></h4>



<p>In 1991, students began to rally for an Asian American studies program and formed the Asian American Collegiate Organization. In 2010, after years of maintaining pressure, the administration established the Asian American studies program and minor. At the same time, UIC received the first five-year AANAPISI grant that designated the campus as a Minority-Serving Institution. Three years later, the Asian American studies and Asian studies faculty began to meet to explore a merger. Coupled with faculty hires made through the Chancellor’s Cluster Initiative that enabled the growth of the program, this eventually led to the formation of the Global Asian Studies Program in 2016. This fall, the first cohort of students will be welcomed by a program that has 5.25 FTE (full-time equivalent) faculty, several affiliated faculty members, a&nbsp;<a href="https://today.uic.edu/bridge-to-faculty-continues-to-grow-as-first-cohort-becomes-faculty/">Bridge to Faculty</a>&nbsp;postdoctoral researcher, a curriculum that is critical, intersectional and comparative in its approaches and engaged with the community. Most importantly, the first cohort of students will learn about and benefit from the long legacy of student activism that built this program, as captured by these&nbsp;<a href="https://glas.uic.edu/about/program-milestones/">milestones</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>What need does it fulfill for students, and how many students are in the cohort?</strong></h4>



<p>The BA in global Asian studies fulfills a longstanding demand from students to major in a field of study that speaks to their lived experiences and histories. It provides a culturally relevant curriculum that gives students the analytical tools to frame and contextualize these experiences and place them within longer histories and more complex geographies and politics. This need has also been recognized by the state with the passage of the&nbsp;<a href="https://truthout.org/articles/illinois-becomes-first-state-to-mandate-teaching-asian-american-history-in-k-12/">Teaching Equitable Asian American Community History Act</a>, which mandates the teaching of Asian American histories in public schools. GLAS is currently beginning an AANAPISI-funded high school to college pipeline initiative, which will also strengthen and extend the reach of this legislation and potentially increase the number of majors and minors in GLAS. From the minute we announced the major, students have declared it, so we expect to see a continuing upward trajectory.</p>



<h4><strong>What can students expect as part of the major?</strong></h4>



<p>Students will have an innovative curriculum anchored by three thematic areas: empire, migration and diaspora; culture and the arts; society, politics and the state. The students will learn from and work with award-winning and dedicated faculty whose expertise represent the fields of American studies, anthropology, art history, communication, criminology, law and justice, education, English, ethnic studies, gender and women’s studies, history, linguistics, political science and sociology. They can expect a curriculum rooted in the community where students can engage in research or work as interns in community organizations. They can expect to gain research skills that will prepare them to work and thrive in today’s diverse and globalized world. They can expect to be part of a program committed to building community and maintaining a strong student-centered focus. They can expect to be welcomed by a student advisory board or even be invited to become part of it.</p>



<h4><strong>Tell us about your work in Uptown and how it relates to the new major?</strong></h4>



<p>My work in Uptown began with the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dis-placements.com/" target="_blank">Dis/Placements: A People’s History of Uptown</a>&nbsp;project that I co-founded with Gayatri Reddy. This is a collaborative, digital, public history project that traces stories of everyday peoples’ resistance in the wake of urban “development” in the North Side Chicago neighborhood of Uptown. Uptown has long been a portal for working-class people, immigrants and refugees, including those from Southeast Asia. The project explores the multiracial solidarities and movements that developed in response to multiple displacements that people experienced, and the ways that they fought back and built resilient communities. The project helps to understand the histories that produced these migrations and places Asian Americans’ lived experiences concerning experiences of other racialized, poor and marginalized communities as they navigate struggles around education, housing, health care and access to human services. In other words, this project is very much in keeping with the goals of the GLAS program and major, providing one among other faculty-led projects that students can engage with to see how these global and local histories and politics intersect and play out in the context of Chicago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19616-4">new report</a> published in the journal Scientific Reports sheds light on the current state of democracy in the United States.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/shutdown-impact-minimal-at-uic/shutdown/"><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="393" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutdown-590x393.jpg" alt="Capitol Building in Washington, DC" class="wp-image-16885" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutdown-590x393.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutdown-387x258.jpg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutdown-600x400.jpg 600w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutdown-500x333.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutdown-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutdown.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>The research by a University of Illinois Chicago social psychologist and colleagues shows that both Democrats and Republicans personally value core democratic principles, such as free and fair elections, but severely underestimate opposing party members’ support for those same characteristics.</p>



<p>Results of this biased underestimation are related to the willingness of individuals, particularly Republicans, to subvert democratic principles themselves, according to the researchers.</p>



<p><a href="https://psch.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/pasek-michael/">Michael Pasek</a>, UIC assistant professor of psychology and the paper’s lead author, points out that for democratic norms to be strong, it’s not enough that people themselves value democratic principles. They must also believe that others — and particularly opposing party members — similarly value democratic principles.</p>



<p>“To the degree that people come to believe that their opponents don’t care about democracy, the prospect of political loss becomes untenable, and anti-democratic behaviors may come to be perceived as justified, even necessary,” Pasek said. “We think that there may be a, perhaps preventable, downward spiral of democratic practice rooted in psychological biases.”</p>



<p>In two surveys of nationally representative panels of Americans, the researchers asked Democrats and Republicans to rate the importance of basic democratic characteristics, like free and fair elections. Survey results show that both Democrats and Republicans highly value basic democratic principles, with average ratings for each group hovering around 90 on a scale from 0 (not at all important) to 100 (extremely important).</p>



<p>The researchers then asked members of each party to estimate how much the average member of their own party — and their opposing party — would value the same characteristics. When asked to make these predictions, Democrats estimate that the average Democrat valued democratic characteristics 56% (in study 1) and 77% (in study 2) more than the average Republican. Similarly, Republicans estimate that the average Republican values democratic characteristics 82% (in study 1) and 88% (in study 2) more than the average Democrat.</p>



<p>Given the high levels of Democrats’ and Republicans’ actual support for democratic principles, the researchers posit that these wildly inaccurate misperceptions likely result from social psychological biases rooted in the fact that political partisanship is increasingly morphing into an “us” vs. “them” dynamic that has previously been shown to drive reciprocal dislike and dehumanization. The polarized media landscape and highly visible anti-democratic behavior by some partisan elites are also mentioned as likely key influencers in shaping citizens’ misperceptions.</p>



<p>While further research is needed on the effectiveness of informational interventions to correct inaccurate intergroup perceptions, the researchers note that maintaining democratic norms in the current political climate requires greater attention to hyper-partisan psychology.</p>



<p>“The maintenance of strong democratic norms ensures that parties have a fair chance to compete for power and that minority rights are protected,” Pasek said. “As we continue to learn more about anti-democratic behavior by elected officials and approach a consequential midterm election where principles of democracy appear to be on the ballot, studies of this kind can help inform the public-at-large and hopefully ease democratic erosion in the United States.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A consortium led by the Nathalie P. Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement at the University of Illinois Chicago has been awarded a five-year, $5 million grant through the U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Manufacturing Community Support Program.</p>



<p>It’s one of six grants totaling approximately $30 million recently presented through the program that makes long-term investments in critical skills, facilities, workforce development, research and development, and small business support in order to strengthen national security innovation.</p>



<p>The Voorhees Center, based in the UIC College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, will lead the Illinois Defense Manufacturing Consortium, which consists of the Illinois Manufacturing Excellence Center and four regional organizations that independently and collectively focus on driving growth in four key defense-intensive-regions comprising 23 counties in Illinois and five counties in Iowa.</p>



<p>Together the partners will launch a Casting, Forging, and Energy Storage Center of Excellence to “introduce new offerings, comprehensive solutions, innovative manufacturing technologies and state-of-the-art workforce training modules targeting underrepresented populations.” </p>



<p>The federal grant is supplemented by an additional $1.6 million in non-federal funds to support the project.</p>



<p>“This grant will allow the Illinois Defense Manufacturing Consortium to develop innovative plans for boosting productivity, while also creating comprehensive programs to expand the skilled defense manufacturing talent pipeline,” said Yittayih Zelalem, director of the Voorhees Center at UIC. “We look forward to collaborating with Illinois Manufacturing Excellence Center and our team of regional partners and economic development organizations in the Quad Cities, Rockford, Peoria and Chicago, as well as with other supporters and stakeholders.”</p>



<p>One goal of the consortium’s Center of Excellence is to strengthen supply chain productivity through the introduction of innovative technology and digital tools that will in turn stimulate market growth.</p>



<p>To expand the skilled manufacturing talent pipeline, the Illinois Defense Manufacturing Consortium will introduce manufacturing careers to high school students, promote employment in manufacturing for underrepresented communities and veterans, and facilitate retraining and employment of displaced workers.</p>



<p>The Voorhees Center will be responsible for coordinating consortium activities as well as providing applied research insights and data analysis; producing infographics and disseminating information through the project website and newsletter; and compiling data collected by partners to report to the sponsor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will also maintain the Supply Chain Mapping Tool, an online platform created by the Voorhees Center that provides users with real-time data for an informed perspective of the federal military’s manufacturing and supply chain in this part of the country.</p>



<p>Partners in the project are the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development represented by Chicago Metro Metals Consortium, Quad Cities Chamber of Commerce, Rockford Area Economic Development Council, Greater Peoria Economic Development Council and Illinois Manufacturing Excellence Center.</p>

<p>Since the Hull-House mansion was built in the mid-19th century, rumors of supernatural happenings in the red brick building have haunted the structure on Chicago’s Near West Side, which survived the Great Chicago Fire and became the spot where Jane Addams created the nation’s first settlement house.</p>



<p>A concrete slab remains in a courtyard in front of the building where legend says a former fountain purportedly served as a portal to hell; the sounds of ghost children allegedly can still be heard running in an upstairs hallway; a “Lady in White” apparition has been said to appear wearing a white dress, and the most famous story of all is known as “The Devil Baby.”</p>



<p>These are only some of the ghostly tales that have abounded where Addams and her partner, Ellen Gates Starr, founded the settlement in 1889. The main home and dining hall survived and now make up the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, which is on the University of Illinois Chicago campus and run by the university.</p>



<p>As the Halloween season approaches, museum officials want to celebrate Hull-House’s haunted history and share ghost stories as they were imparted by Jane Addams and the people in the surrounding neighborhood, said Ross Jordan, interim director and curatorial manager of the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum.</p>



<p>“The aim is to highlight these supernatural stories and the greater implications of those narratives,” Jordan said. “Through our October event series, we will touch on their psychological and sociological roots, the effects that Jane Addams saw them having on the people around her, and how we continue to see those effects today.”</p>

<p>In a 1916 article in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1916/10/the-devil-baby-at-hull-house/305428/">The Atlantic</a> penned by Addams titled, “The Devil Baby at Hull House: A tale of poverty, superstition and the struggles of ordinary women,” she discusses how the rumor of a child born with cloven hoofs, pointed ears, a tail and spewing vulgarities sparked scores of women to come to the home demanding to see the child even after repeatedly being told that the child did not exist.</p>



<p>Addams wrote in her article that women, especially, looked to the story for meaning in their own lives and their lot in life. They were often victims of domestic abuse by fathers, husbands and sons who often drank their wages and left the women struggling to maintain their families.</p>



<p>“As our visitors to the Devil Baby came day by day, it was gradually evident that the simpler women were moved not wholly by curiosity, but that many of them prized the story as a valuable instrument in the business of living. The legend exhibited all the persistence of one of those tales which have doubtless been preserved through the centuries because of their taming effects upon recalcitrant husbands and fathers,” Addams wrote.</p>

<p>The site is known as one of the most haunted places both in Chicago and the United States and is a frequent stop on Chicago ghost tours. Museum officials hope to tap into that interest in October by offering night tours of Hull-House with proceeds going to education programs, Jordan said.</p>



<p>They also teamed up with viral internet sensations Ryan Bergara and Shane Madej, whose new ghost hunting series, “Ghost Files,” tracks paranormal activity around the country. The duo will focus on Hull-House this season and filmed an episode during an overnight investigation at Hull-House in July.</p>

<p>Nanoscale materials represent a class of substances that approach the size of individual atoms, about 0.1 to 10 nanometers, in at least one dimension. These materials exhibit properties that are unique from larger scale substances, and they are essential to advancing a wide array of technologies, from magnetic data-storage systems to superconducting quantum computers to biomaterials and biomedical applications.</p>

Electron microscopy, which uses electron beams to “see” atoms, is one of the fundamental means by which the structures of nanoscale materials can be studied.</p>



<p>Current designs of high-resolution transmission electron microscopes require a lens to focus an electron beam on the specimen surface, said University of Illinois Chicago physicist Robert Klie.</p>



<p>“A side effect of this design is that the sample material is inadvertently exposed to a high magnetic field, so turning the lens off to eliminate the magnetic field when studying magnetic or superconducting materials makes atomic-resolution analysis impossible,” he said.</p>



<p>UIC researchers will soon have a new tool built to overcome the side effect.</p>



<p>Through an $4 million National Science Foundation grant, UIC will be home to the world’s first analytical, aberration-corrected and monochromated transmission electron microscope with a magnetic field-free objective lens. UIC, through the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, will contribute the required cost-share of 30%, or $1.7 million, toward the total instrument cost. OVCR will also contribute nearly $4M to renovate space in the Center for Structural Biology not only to house this microscope, but to refresh some of their other shared research facilities.</p>



<p>“The instrument acquired through this grant has a new lens design, providing a magnetic-field-free sample region and, when combined with a nearly mono-energetic electron source, allows for atomic-resolution imaging as well as chemical analysis of these critical materials,” said Klie, UIC professor of physics and the project’s principal investigator.</p>



<p>The instrument will also be equipped with several sample or specimen stages that allow researchers to heat, cool or expose materials to liquids or a controlled magnetic field. The monochromated electron source will also allow for new spectroscopy measurements of materials that undergo changes in structure or properties, including magnetic ordering or superconducting transition, at atomic resolution.</p>



<p>Students and scientists at UIC, and across the Midwest and U.S., will also benefit from the microscope acquisition, according to the researchers. The only other microscope similar to this in the world is currently at the University of Tokyo.</p>



<p>Results from experiments using the field-free transmission electron microscope will be integrated into new and existing courses at UIC and help inform new online teaching resources. Annual workshops, sessions at national and international conferences and engagement with local microscopy societies are also part of the principal investigators’ plans.</p>



<p>“In awarding this grant to UIC, the foundation acknowledged the university’s status as a Research-1 level institution and its ability to deliver hands-on research and learning opportunities in cutting-edge quantum, superconducting or biomaterials science to a diverse undergraduate and graduate student community,” Klie said.</p>



<p>The award is issued through the National Science Foundation’s Major Research Instrumentation Program, which supports the development or acquisition of multi-user research instruments that are critical to the advancement of science and engineering, specifically for research and research training at institutions of higher education and not-for-profit scientific/engineering research organizations.</p>



<p>Serving as co-principal investigators on the project are Russell Hemley, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Distinguished Chair in the Natural Sciences; Jordi Cabana, UIC professor of chemistry; Thomas Searles, UIC associate professor of electrical and computer engineering; and Matthew Daly, UIC assistant professor of civil, materials and environmental engineering. Additional UIC co-principal investigators and senior personnel involved with the project are Fengyuan Shi, director of the Electron Microscopy Core; Kevin Boergens, research assistant professor of physics; Rus Pesavento, research assistant professor of oral biology; Preston Snee, associate professor of chemistry; Jeremiah Abiade, associate professor of mechanical and industrial engineering; Reza Shahbazian-Yassar, professor of mechanical and industrial engineering; and George Crabtree, director of the UIC Energy Initiative and distinguished professor of physics, and electrical and mechanical engineering.</p>

(Joshua Clark/University of Illinois Chicago)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">The study was one of five led by Lee Friedman, associate professor of environmental and occupational health sciences in the UIC School of Public Health, in conjunction with Alfreda Holloway-Beth of the Cook County Department of Public Health and the CDC. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">The goal was to capture regional data so that public health authorities might better fight the opioid crisis. According to the CDC, </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2773065422000062#bib0006"><span data-contrast="none">Cook County was ranked second in the nation</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> for fatal overdoses in 2020, with </span><a href="https://www.cookcountyil.gov/news/cook-county-opioid-overdoses-2021-set-surpass-2020-numbers"><span data-contrast="none">2021 deaths surpassing 2020 numbers</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“We began to have this kind of hunch that maybe we’re missing those people who are dying in the hospital because they’re older,&#8221; Friedman said. “They don’t fit the profile, the stereotype — actually, the stigma — of someone with an opioid use disorder.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">The study compared hospital records with Cook County medical examiner data relating to 4,936 deaths that included clinical signs of overdose and met a national case definition for opioid overdose. Researchers found that at least 633 deaths occurring in hospitals that met the criteria of opioid overdose were not correctly identified on death records reported by the CDC from 2016 to 2019. The majority of deaths the CDC missed occurred in hospitals.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Researchers also found that only 19.5% of deceased hospital patients who presented overdose symptoms had their cause of death confirmed by a medical examiner autopsy. Even when hospital staff flagged a patient with a medical code for opioid overdose, the&nbsp;medical examiner confirmed the diagnosis just 24% of the time.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Those least likely to be autopsied included deceased patients over 50 and patients of all ages diagnosed with chronic health conditions, especially malignant cancer, as well as those who were taking prescription opioids. This held even for cancer patients identified as having an opioid use disorder. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Previous studies have shown that nationwide, the undercount of opioid-related deaths may be as high as 20% to 40% based on death certificate records alone. This is due largely to the fact that many death certificates record an “unspecified drug overdose” as the cause of death rather than linking fatalities specifically to the opioid epidemic. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Prior studies also attribute undercounts to increased use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which is 10 times stronger than heroin. However, this new research from UIC shows that overdoses from prescription opioids are also significantly undercounted. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Friedman noted that since Cook County has one of the most well-funded and well-staffed medical examiners in the nation, prescription opioid overdose undercounts in less well-funded regions could be even more severe. Officially, opioids were responsible for three-quarters of the 108,000 drug overdose deaths reported by the CDC in 2021.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The newest clinical building on the University of Illinois Chicago’s health sciences campus will open to patients Sept. 26.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leadership from UIC and its health system, UI Health, marked the occasion with a ribbon-cutting event outside the $194 million building Sept. 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Specialty Care Building, at 1009 S. Wood St., is the new home to Illinois Eye and Ear at UI Health, which previously was located at 1855 W. Taylor St. It is also the location of the new Bruno and Sallie Pasquinelli Outpatient Surgery Center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The building is projected to serve 600 to 800 patients per day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UIC Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs Dr. Robert Barish kicked off the celebration and welcomed distinguished guests, including&nbsp;University of Illinois System President Timothy Killeen, Chicago 27th Ward Ald. Walter Burnett Jr., and Illinois 9th District Rep. Lakesia Collins. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Specialty Care Building was designed to meet the growing need for specialized services and outpatient surgery in the Chicago metropolitan area. The state-of-the-art facility has nearly 200,000 square feet of surgical and patient care space dedicated to providing an exceptional health care experience for patients and their families.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The building includes six floors of patient care space, with eight operating and eight procedure rooms, and 48 surgery bays. It also includes 182 rooms for gastroenterology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, transplant and urology care specialty clinics, and a pharmacy. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The new building also will include new technology and functionality for an improved patient experience, from check-in kiosks to valet parking and intuitive wayfinding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Construction of the building, which was contracted to Pepper/Brown and Momen Construction, employed around 500 individuals over the course of the two-year project. Approximately 20% of professional services and 35% of construction vendors were local minority, women, persons with disabilities and veteran-owned businesses certified under the Business Enterprise Program Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operations and expanded clinical services in the new building are expected to create more than 100 full-time positions once it is fully operational. The majority of new jobs include positions that are part of the university’s collective bargaining units.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the public-private partnership between UIC and Provident Resources Group, a 501(c)(3) corporation, Provident financed 100% of the construction&nbsp;through tax-exempt bonds and now leases the facility to UI Health for the 30-year term of the bonds. Additional funding for medical equipment and furnishings was provided by private philanthropy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What people have said:</h2>



<p><span class="TextRun SCXW58092803 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW58092803 BCX0" data-ccp-parastyle="No Spacing">&#8220;The incredible new UI Health Specialty Care Building illustrates the power of collaboration and partnership to drive real change in the lives of the citizens of Illinois,&#8221; <strong>University of Illinois System President Tim Killeen</strong> said. &#8220;Through the public-private partnership that made this new facility possible, UI Health will ensure better outcomes for its patients. Partnerships like this and those the U of I System is part of across the state are offering more and better access to education, health care and economic opportunities that will help Illinoisans thrive in the decades ahead.</span></span>&#8220;</p>



<p>“Today’s ribbon-cutting is first and foremost about the thousands of residents in Chicago and Illinois who will have increased access to world-class health care. Additionally, it is about the jobs this facility will bring, and the hundreds of students pursuing careers in the health sciences who will benefit from learning in this new clinical environment,” <strong>UIC Interim Chancellor Javier Reyes</strong> said. “The Specialty Care Building is yet another example of our mission to invest in our patients, and our students, faculty, staff and partners, by providing us with new and much-needed space, and the tools to advance our efforts to serve our diverse communities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Today we pause to recognize your incredible teamwork and dedication to the vision of the UI Health Specialty Care Building,&#8221; <strong>UIC Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs Dr. Robert Barish</strong> said. &#8220;Through the work each of you has put into this project, UI Health is fulfilling its mission of delivering outstanding care, making innovative medical discoveries and training tomorrow’s health care leaders.&#8221;</p>



<p>“The opening of the Specialty Care Building fulfills a decadeslong vision to provide our patients with an expanded state-of the-art destination to receive world-class specialty and surgical care,”<strong> University of Illinois College of Medicine Executive Dean Dr. Mark Rosenblatt</strong> said. “The building represents a partnership between the College of Medicine and UI Health to deliver on our shared mission to advance health for everyone through advances in clinical care, education, research and social responsibility. In the Specialty Care Building, our faculty will not only provide expert clinical care to our community but will also train the next generation of talented physicians and make research discoveries that will have impact in the lives of patients.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This building supports not just the medical health, but the economic health of our communities, and gives us a better platform to continue our service throughout the West and South sides of Chicago,&#8221; <strong>University of Illinois Hospital and Clinics CEO Michael Zenn</strong> said. &#8220;The Specialty Care Building is a significant tool in our drive to address the inequities of access which are at the core of disparities in health outcomes.” </p>

<p>Diversity officials at the University of Illinois Chicago are announcing a new cohort of Bridge to Faculty scholars as they celebrate the initial group of scholars transitioning to become UIC faculty members.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/faculty/bridge-to-faculty/">Bridge to Faculty program</a>, which is entering its third year, is designed to increase faculty diversity at UIC. The program, also known as B2F, was created in the summer of 2019, and this fall welcomes seven new scholars.</p>



<p>The 2022 scholar cohort was recognized at a recent in-person reception honoring the new scholars, continuing scholars and new faculty members.</p>



<p>UIC Interim Chancellor Javier Reyes said the program has been such a success that many Hispanic-Serving Institutions across the country are developing similar initiatives to diversify faculty. He congratulated all the scholars and departments for creating an environment to champion diversity.</p>



<p>He credited Amalia Pallares, vice chancellor for diversity, equity and engagement, for developing the initiative, which is coordinated through the Office of Diversity, Equity and Engagement.</p>



<p>“I have no doubt that this will be another blueprint for the nation on how to create a culture from the departments and their needs to advance racial equity,” Reyes said. “This is working — let&#8217;s continue to work to champion diversity at UIC.”</p>



<p><a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/uribe-david/">David Hernández Uribe</a>, in the department of earth and environmental sciences, said he is happy to begin the program as a new scholar because it gives researchers a way to ease into the faculty position. The two-year program allows him and other Bridge to Faculty scholars time to search for funding, develop research ideas and check in with advisers on tenure-track career paths.</p>



<p>“That’s a really important part of the program; it puts together a really diverse group of people who will make science richer,” said Hernández Uribe, a geologist whose research centers on using rocks to understand the evolution of continents.</p>



<p><a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/burton-tristesse/">Tristesse Burton</a>, a Chicago native in the department of pharmacy practice, called the program a “phenomenal opportunity” for individuals like herself who are underrepresented in academia. The program allows them to “situate ourselves on an even playing field,” said Burton, whose research addresses perinatal health for maternal mortality among Black and Indigenous women.</p>



<p>“I am very excited. I like the great opportunity to work in a cohort setting so we will be able to hold each other accountable and also lean on each other for advice,” Burton said.</p>



<p><a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/monteiro-andrea/">Andrea Monteiro</a>, in the department of pharmacy practice, said as a member of the newest cohort, she looks to the success of the two previous cohorts as inspiration. Her research focuses on patient-reported outcomes and preferences.</p>



<p>“It gives you hope. What I love about this program is the fact that there is a structured way of taking you in and showing you the way of becoming an independent researcher,” Monteiro said. “This can be a very frustrating moment in your life.”</p>



<p>Other members of the new cohort include:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/ansari-david/">David Ansari</a>, in the department of medical education, whose research focuses on the mental health and well-being of health professionals and how health professionals support vulnerable clients.</li><li><a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/guerrero-mayra/">Mayra Guerrero</a>, in the department of psychology, whose research centers on examining the social and contextual factors promoting the well-being of marginalized populations.</li><li><a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/lopez-garcia-david/">David López-García</a>, in the department of urban planning and policy, whose postdoctoral research project examines inequalities of accessibility to jobs mediated by race and socioeconomic characteristics in U.S. cities.</li><li><a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/meza-ignacio/">Ignacio Escalante Meza</a>, in the department of biological sciences, who is a tropical biologist studying the mechanisms of animal behavior through the lenses of ecology and evolutionary biology.</li></ul>



<p>Pallares said the program is currently working on gathering new scholars for the fourth cohort for the fall of 2023. She said the fact that all 10 of the original members of the first cohort have transitioned to become faculty members is a milestone.</p>



<p>“This is a community program; it is really about building a connected community we want for our scholars to come to and become successful with,” Pallares said. “Your energy, enthusiasm and brilliance have reinvigorated us.”</p>



<p>The seven new scholars are joining the 17 members in the second cohort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of Bridge to Faculty is to provide time and resources to allow scholars to establish their research and support their success and potential transition to a tenure-track position. The scholars’ research spans a wide variety of disciplines and departments throughout the university.</p>

(Joshua Clark/University of Illinois Chicago)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Mexican archaeologist <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/solinis-casparius-rodrigo/">Rodrigo Solinís-Casparius</a> is part of the first cohort and is now an assistant professor of anthropology at UIC.</p>



<p>His work examines ancient urbanism and how people lived and constructed cities, particularly in ancient Mexico and Central America. He also focuses on technology to map and study archaeological remains and the work that archaeologists do with local and Indigenous communities to create and recover knowledge, Solinís-Casparius said.</p>



<p>“Being a B2F scholar put me close to resources, initiatives and work done by the Office of Diversity, Equity and Engagement and other units,” Solinís-Casparius said. “Whatever the field, B2F is a robust program that helps junior scholars develop their work, integrate into the UIC community and transition to faculty while appreciating the privilege to serve students from underrepresented identities.”</p>



<p><a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/villegas-jose/">José Villegas</a>, who grew up dividing his time between the United States and Mexico, was in the first cohort and became a faculty member three weeks ago. Villegas, who is in the department of pharmaceutical sciences, said he was able start his research early, which he can continue with as a professor. He was able to set up a lab and recruit students to work on his research.</p>



<p>“Typically, you’re trying to do research and at the same time land a faculty position, but here you’ve gotten that out of the way and are ready to commit to a certain place,” Villegas said.</p>



<p>Along with Solinís-Casparius and Villegas, other members who have transitioned to faculty from the first cohort include <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/becerra-marisol-2/">Marisol Becerra</a>, <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/brown-lawrence-2/">Lawrence Brown</a>, <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/gerazime-roselyne-2/">Roselyne Gérazime</a>, <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/hampton-marcell-jarrad-2/">Jarrad Hampton-Marcell,</a> <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/lopez-garcia-maria/">Maria Eugenia López-Garcia</a>, <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/martin-annette/">Annette Martín</a>, <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/michelen-marcus/">Marcus Michelen</a> and <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/torres-stephanie/">Stephanie Torres</a>. <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/smith-ariel/">Ariel Smith</a>, a scholar affiliate, has also successfully transitioned to faculty. One scholar from the second cohort, <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/prowp-content/uploads/nunez-mir-gabriela/">Gabriela Nunez-Mir</a>, has also transitioned to faculty.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sept. 19 event celebrates longtime political scientist, former Chicago alderman]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For over five decades, Dick Simpson has been an influential figure in Chicago and synonymous with the University of Illinois Chicago. His involvement with the city and university will continue, but in a different manner, as he embarks on the “good fight” in retirement.</p>



<p>Simpson, UIC professor emeritus of political science, will be honored during a special Constitution Day UIC Alumni Exchange event, where he will converse with Steven Schwinn, UIC professor of law, about the complex web of political, social and economic challenges he sees endangering the state of American democracy.</p>



<p><strong>WHEN:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Sept. 19</p>



<p>Reception at 11:30 a.m.</p>

<p>Union League Club of Chicago</p>



<p>65 W. Jackson Blvd.  </p>



<p><strong>DETAILS:</strong></p>



<p>Dick Simpson, a former Chicago alderman, established himself as an authority on political matters of all kinds, from corruption and voting patterns to budgeting and civic engagement. While producing reform-influencing research and more than a dozen books, he has always taken pride in his teaching. He has shared his expertise widely beyond UIC classrooms as a frequent contributor to media coverage of city and state politics.</p>



<p>During the UIC Alumni Exchange event honoring his 55-year UIC career, Simpson will address themes covered in his new book, &#8220;Democracy&#8217;s Rebirth: The View from Chicago,&#8221; and discuss eight specific crises he’s identified and his proposals for how to create a more participatory democracy.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The UI Health Specialty Care Building was designed to meet the growing need for specialized services and outpatient surgery in the Chicago metropolitan area. The state-of-the-art facility has nearly 200,000 square feet of surgical and patient care space dedicated to providing an exceptional health care experience for patients and their families.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The building is projected to host 600 to 800 patients per day and includes six floors of patient care space, with eight operating and eight procedure rooms, and 48 surgery bays. It also includes 182 rooms for gastrointestinal, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, transplant and urology care specialty clinics, and a pharmacy. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The new state-of-the-art building will also include new technology and functionality for an improved patient experience, from check-in kiosks, valet parking and intuitive wayfinding.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Construction of the building, which was contracted to Pepper/Brown and Momen Construction, employed around 500 individuals over the course of the two-year project. Approximately 20% of professional services and 35% of construction vendors were local minority, women, persons with disabilities and veteran-owned businesses certified under the Business Enterprise Program Act.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Operations and expanded clinical services in the new building are expected to create more than 100 full-time positions once it is fully operational. The majority of these new jobs include positions that are part of the university’s collective bargaining units.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Under the public-private partnership between UIC and Provident Resources Group, a 501(c)(3) corporation, Provident financed 100% of the construction&nbsp;through tax-exempt bonds and now leases the facility to UI Health for the 30-year term of the bonds. Additional funding for medical equipment and furnishings was provided by private philanthropy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago’s status among the country’s top public national universities continues to grow as the institution rose four spots to tie for 42nd in the 2022-2023 U.S. News &amp; World Report’s Best Colleges rankings. UIC also landed among the top 100 national universities by jumping six spots to tie for 97th in the publication’s latest rankings. &nbsp;</p>

<p>UIC’s undergraduate nursing program moved to ninth in the nation, a leap of 10 spots from the previous year’s ranking. Computer science, engineering and business each earned places among the nation’s top 100 undergraduate academic programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university’s commitment to diversity, to the social mobility of its students, and to providing an affordable education also was recognized in the national rankings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>UIC is 11th among top performers in social mobility, a category that measures the extent schools enrolled and graduated students who receive federal Pell grants, which are given to students whose total family incomes are less than $50,000 annually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For ethnic diversity, which identifies colleges where students are most likely to encounter undergraduates from racial or ethnic groups different than their own, UIC ranked in a tie for 23rd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The university tied for 37th in economic diversity, a category that highlights schools with the largest percentage of undergraduates receiving federal Pell grants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>UIC ranked 45th in least debt, a new category that considers whose students graduated carrying the lightest debt load.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UIC also tied for 61st among best colleges for veterans, tied for 68th for most innovative schools and placed 86th in A-plus schools for B students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“U.S. News &amp; World Report’s rankings are the latest indicator of the impactful teaching and learning environment that is accessible at Chicago’s only public research university,“ UIC Interim Chancellor Javier Reyes said. “UIC continues to be a place where success and achievement are cultivated, and an affordable world-class education is propelling our next generation of leaders, innovators and scholars to reach their goals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To calculate the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/best-colleges">rankings</a>, U.S. News &amp; World Report focuses on academic quality and places emphasis on outcome measures — including graduation rates, retention rates, graduate indebtedness and social mobility. Outcomes are the most highly weighted ranking factor, contributing 40% to each school&#8217;s overall score. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[New study shows even low doses of alcohol prime brain for addiction  ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span data-contrast="none">A new rodent study shows that even small quantities of alcohol can trigger epigenomic and transciptomic changes in brain circuitry in an area that is crucial in the development of addiction.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">What’s more, the University of Illinois Chicago researchers who conducted the study say that the pathways involved in priming the brain for addiction are the same ones that are associated with the highs of drinking, like euphoria and anxiolysis, the clinical term for a level of sedation in which a person is relaxed but awake.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">“This suggests that when the brain experiences the anti-anxiety effects of alcohol and the mood lift — the relaxation and the buzz — it is also being primed for alcohol use disorder,” said the study&#8217;s senior author Subhash Pandey, the Joseph A. Flaherty endowed professor of psychiatry and director of the Center for Alcohol Research in Epigenetics in the UIC College of Medicine.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">While Pandey says the study does not suggest, for example, that one drink leads to addiction in humans, it does provide some clues as to why some people are more vulnerable to alcohol use disorder.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“We’re seeing that dependent behaviors may not always be from long-term, high-quantity habits but a result of rapid epigenetic changes in the brain, which we show in this study may start happening even at low doses,” said Pandey, who is also a senior research career scientist at the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">A paper published in Molecular Psychiatry details Pandey’s experiments, which studied rats under control and alcohol exposure conditions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">In the experiments, rodents were exposed to low concentrations of alcohol and their behaviors were observed as they explored a maze. Then the researchers analyzed brain tissue samples, collected after euthanasia, with RNA sequencing and looked for gene expression patterns.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">When they analyzed the samples, the researchers found that a gene called hypoxia inducible factor 3 alpha subunit — Hif3a, for short — was associated with changes in the brain after alcohol exposure and behaviors, like how long rats stayed in areas of the maze with enclosed (high anxiety) or open arms (low anxiety).</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Alcohol increased Hif3a expression, even after low doses of exposure, and reduced anxiety. And, while many effects of alcohol are different among males and females, there was no difference between the two in this study.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“We saw that low doses, what we consider ‘social drinking,’ changes the gene expression in the amygdala, a brain region that regulates anxiety. In other words, it creates an epigenetic pathway for addiction,” Pandey said.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Pandey and his colleagues also set up additional experiments in which they blocked the gene in the amygdala of rats with or without alcohol exposure to validate its role mediating anxiety. When Hif3a was blocked, anxiety was increased in control rats, mimicking withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure. On the other hand, this also prevented the anti-anxiety effects of alcohol.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The researchers showed why, too. Hif3a’s chromatin — bundles of DNA and RNA — is loosely bundled, meaning the genes are easily accessible for transcription changes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">One thing the study does not suggest, however, is what level of alcohol exposure was safe for rodents. Instead, Pandey said, it’s important to know that low doses created a priming for addiction. For people, he thinks the takeaway is simple — don’t assume social drinking or even “pandemic drinking” is without risk.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“Alcohol use disorder is complex and challenging to overcome. The information we learned from this study helps us to understand better what is happening in the brain and, one day, may be leveraged to develop better treatments and pharmaceuticals,” Pandey said.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">The University of Illinois Chicago will receive $6 million from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to establish the newest Agricultural Safety and Health Center in the U.S. The new center, called the Great Lakes Center for Farmworker Health and Wellbeing</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> will be housed at the UIC School of Public Health.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">In Illinois, 35,000 to 55,000 farmworkers migrate or shift into agriculture in summer. They typically live in extreme poverty, with poor housing, limited transportation, food insecurity, lack of health care and preventive services, and long distances to social services.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“These workers are profoundly disadvantaged, despite their critical importance to the food supply chain. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I think everyone understood the important role they play,” said Dr. Linda Forst, the UIC School of Public Health professor who led the proposal for the new center and will serve as its director. “Farmworkers are a precious resource in the United States, and we should want to protect that resource.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><a href="https://today.uic.edu/primer-centro-federal-enfocado-en-la-salud-y-seguridad-de-los-trabajadores-agricolas-abrira-en-chicago/"><strong>En español</strong></a></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Forst’s research has focused on the occupational health of low-wage workers and contingent, seasonal or precariously employed workers. She said that farmworkers who fall into this category are the most disadvantaged workforce in the United States. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Among <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/default.html">the most dangerous job sectors in the country</a>, the farming industry&nbsp;has <a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/work/industry-incidence-rates/most-dangerous-industries/">the highest death rate per 100,000 workers</a>. </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">&#8220;They don&#8217;t have paid sick leave, they don&#8217;t have access to health care,” said Forst, professor of environmental and occupational health sciences in the UIC School of Public Health. “And they really don&#8217;t have choices about whether they work or they don&#8217;t work, because their wages are so low.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Many farmworkers, she noted, are not formally employed, so it is very difficult for public institutions to collect data on them. NIOSH has funded several of Forst’s projects on farmworkers, and the center will include a new collaboration between the UIC School of Public Health and the College of Agriculture, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which has key connections with the farming industry. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}">&nbsp;</span></p>

Taken by the laboratory of Linda Forst during field work in Florida.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The center will begin its research in Illinois with a census of all the migratory, seasonal and H2-A visa farmworkers in the state to get a basic headcount of the workforce along with a tabulation of farm-related injuries. The center team will then translate NIOSH’s Worker Wellbeing Questionnaire into Spanish and administer it to the Illinois farmworker population. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The center researchers are working to secure funding for a third research project that would allow them to conduct blood tests for biomarkers of stress and inflammation in farmworkers to see how these relate to health and well-being. Center researchers also will network with NIOSH Agricultural Centers and researchers in other states.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:257}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Forst’s collaborators include Elena Grossman, Tessa Bonney, Michael Siciliano, Tim Johnson, Dana Madigan and Lee Friedman from UIC, and Josie Rudolphi, Salah Issa, Jessica Brinkworth and Charee Thompson from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In addition, the University of Illinois Extension, Community Health Partnership of Illinois, Legal Aid Chicago and several government and non-government organizations will take part in the center’s work.</span> <span style="font-size: revert; color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">A team of researchers led by </span><span data-contrast="auto">Meenesh </span><span data-contrast="none">Singh at University of Illinois Chicago has discovered a way to convert 100% of carbon dioxide captured from</span> <span data-contrast="auto">industrial exhaust</span><span data-contrast="none"> into ethylene, a key building block for plastic products.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Their findings are published in </span><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(22)00347-2"><span data-contrast="none">Cell Reports Physical Science</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">While researchers have been exploring the possibility of converting carbon dioxide to ethylene for more than a decade, the UIC team’s approach is the first to achieve nearly 100% utilization of carbon dioxide to produce hydrocarbons. Their system uses electrolysis to transform captured carbon dioxide gas into high purity ethylene, with other carbon-based fuels and oxygen as byproducts. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">The process can convert up to 6 metric tons of carbon dioxide into 1 metric ton of ethylene,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> recycling almost all carbon dioxide captured. Because the system runs on electricity, the use of renewable energy can make the process carbon negative.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to Singh, his team’s approach surpasses the net-zero carbon goal of other carbon capture and conversion</span> <span data-contrast="auto">technologies by actually reducing the total carbon dioxide output from industry. “It’s a net negative,” he said. “For every 1 ton of ethylene produced, you’re taking 6 tons of CO</span><span data-contrast="auto">2</span><span data-contrast="auto"> from point sources that otherwise would be released to the atmosphere.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Previous attempts at converting carbon dioxide into ethylene have relied on reactors that produce ethylene within the source</span> <span data-contrast="none">carbon dioxide emission stream. In these cases, as little as 10% of CO</span><span data-contrast="none">2 </span><span data-contrast="none">emissions typically converts to ethylene. The ethylene must later be separated from the carbon dioxide in an energy-intensive process often involving fossil fuels</span><span data-contrast="auto">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">In UIC’s approach, an electric current is passed through a cell, half of which is filled with captured </span><span data-contrast="auto">carbon dioxide, the other half with a water-based solution. An electrified catalyst draws charged hydrogen atoms from the water molecules into the other half of the unit separated by a membrane, where they combine with charged carbon atoms from the carbon dioxide molecules to form ethylene.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Among manufactured chemicals worldwide, ethylene ranks third for carbon emissions after ammonia and cement.&nbsp;Ethylene is used not only to create plastic products for the packaging, agricultural and automotive industries, but also to produce chemicals used in antifreeze, medical sterilizers and vinyl siding for houses.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Ethylene is usually made in a process called steam cracking that requires enormous amounts of heat. Cracking generates</span> <span data-contrast="auto">about</span><span data-contrast="none"> 1.5 metric tons of carbon emissions per ton of ethylene created. On average, manufacturers produce around 160 million tons of ethylene each year, which results in more than </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/business/petrochemicals/search-greener-ethylene/99/i9"><span data-contrast="none">260 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">In addition to ethylene, the UIC scientists were able to produce other carbon-rich products useful to industry with their </span><span data-contrast="auto">electrolysis</span> <span data-contrast="auto">approach</span><span data-contrast="none">. They also achieved a very high solar energy conversion efficiency, converting 10% of energy from the solar panels directly to carbon product output. This is well above the </span><span data-contrast="auto">state-of-the-art standard</span><span data-contrast="none"> of 2%. For all the ethylene they produced, the solar energy conversion efficiency was around 4%, approximately the same rate as photosynthesis</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Incoming freshmen, international, online and graduate student enrollment increased this year at the University of Illinois Chicago, the city’s largest and only public research university.</p>



<p>Incoming freshmen increased by 1.6% to 4,244, and for the sixth consecutive year, new transfer students were greater than 2,000, with 2,110 choosing UIC. The number of degree-seeking international students continued its rise to 4,263 from 3,890, an increase of 9.6% over last year. This figure includes 2,621 graduate and professional students and 1,642 undergraduate students and exceeds pre-pandemic international student enrollment.</p>



<p>“UIC continues to gain momentum in reaching students to deliver a transformational world-class education that impacts our communities in Chicago and beyond,” UIC Interim Chancellor Javier Reyes said. “At the helm of UIC’s accessible and affordable education is innovative teaching, research and learning experiences.”</p>



<p>Fully online programs jumped by 17.5% over last year to 1,434 students. This growth is primarily attributed to the demand for fully online programs prior to and following the pandemic. This year, an online MBA program that began in 2021 showed an 810% increase in enrollment from 19 to 173 graduate students this fall.</p>



<p>In addition, the number of total graduate students increased 1.3% to 7,798 students compared with 7,697 students last year.</p>



<p>While UIC’s overall enrollment dropped slightly to 33,747 from a record 34,199 in 2021, it remains 1.1% higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2019.</p>



<p>All figures are based on enrollment from the first 10 days of classes, the traditional benchmark for enrollment data among U.S. colleges and universities.</p>



<p>UIC continues to be one of the most diverse campuses in the country — 42% of freshmen are Hispanic, 21% are Asian and 8% are Black.</p>



<p>Among UIC’s 16 colleges, the College of Business Administration showed the largest enrollment gains with an increase of 7% or 340 new students, for a total enrollment of 5,114 undergraduate and graduate students. The College of Engineering also showed an increase of 95 students, for a total enrollment of 5,744 undergraduate and graduate students. For the health sciences colleges, the largest gains were seen for&nbsp;professional students in Applied Health Sciences (26% increase) and for undergraduate students in the College of Nursing (6% increase).</p>

(Jenny Fontaine/University of Illinois Chicago)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Eliza Abdullai</strong>, a first-time student studying civil engineering from Hinsdale, said what drew her to UIC was that it was the only public research university in Chicago.</p>



<p>“UIC is a very good school for engineering; it’s one of the top research institutions,” Abdullai said. “You’re in Chicago, so you are always surrounded by opportunities.”</p>



<p><strong>Oscar Hernandez-Daguer</strong>, a graduate student from Colombia working on his doctorate in physics, said he chose UIC because of the opportunity to learn from professors involved in their own innovative research.</p>



<p>“In the future, I would like to be able to do X-ray research, and one of the biggest research groups working on that topic is here,” Hernandez-Daguer said.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/oscar-hernandez-daguer/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Oscar-Hernandez-Daguer_4x6-172x258.jpg" alt="Oscar Hernandez-Daguer" class="wp-image-135730" width="210" height="315" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Oscar-Hernandez-Daguer_4x6-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Oscar-Hernandez-Daguer_4x6-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Oscar-Hernandez-Daguer_4x6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Oscar-Hernandez-Daguer_4x6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Oscar-Hernandez-Daguer_4x6-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Oscar-Hernandez-Daguer_4x6-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Oscar-Hernandez-Daguer_4x6.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a><figcaption>Oscar Hernandez-Daguer</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Emily McCartan</strong>, a first-time student from Chicago, said she chose to attend UIC because her father had also attended the school and spoke highly of his education here. She said that she also chose UIC because it allowed her to start her college career without having to declare a major, though she is leaning toward nursing.</p>



<p>“I didn’t really feel super big pressure on me to immediately decide what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, because I felt I could ease my way into college,” McCartan said.</p>



<p><strong>Grace Travis</strong>, who is also a first-time student, said she is studying occupational therapy and UIC’s pull for her was that she fell in love with the campus and UIC had the major she wanted. The icing on the cake was that UIC was in the heart of Chicago.</p>



<p>“I just love the city. I wanted to be in the city,” said Travis, who is from Evergreen Park.</p>



<h4>On the diversity of UIC:</h4>

(Jenny Fontaine/University of Illinois Chicago)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Sanchit Vinod Gangwal</strong>, a senior who is from India, came to UIC in the fall of 2019. After exploring different majors, he decided to settle on business and felt UIC would give him “a head start toward the American dream.”</p>



<p>“UIC is not just based in one of the most progressive cities in the entire world but also has diversity as one of its prime agendas to make students feel at home even when far from home,” he said. “I have friends from my high school studying at universities across the United States. But I have not heard about a culture that genuinely focuses on the growth of students on an individual level like UIC’s.”</p>



<p><strong>Annie Luu</strong>, who is from Vietnam and is a second-year student studying marketing, credited school leaders with helping foster diversity on campus and was impressed by the academics, especially within her field.</p>



<p>“There’s so many people from all around the world coming here,” Luu said. “They have a really good business career office where they can help us find jobs. That was one of the reasons I wanted to come here.”</p>

<p>Hundreds of young children in the United States are expelled or suspended daily from child care and preschool classrooms at a rate nearly three times that of kindergarten through 12th-grade students.</p>



<p>Despite recent efforts by policymakers to address what researchers describe as an almost two-decade crisis, disparities in who is expelled continue.</p>



<p>Drawing on her research and interviews with hundreds of teachers, program administrators, parents and policymakers, a new book by University of Illinois Chicago early childhood researcher Kate Zinsser aims to bring context to the disciplinary decisions being made while bringing the conversation about the crisis to the public at large.</p>



<p><a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fbook%2F43194&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cbflood%40uic.edu%7Ce75027557e934df524e708da860eb1da%7Ce202cd477a564baa99e3e3b71a7c77dd%7C0%7C0%7C637969694914289831%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wnApXQYRQnID6Z7y9vXV3SiwmRx80%2FkeU6FCipcQE0A%3D&amp;reserved=0">“No Longer Welcome: The Epidemic of Expulsion from Early Childhood Education”</a> examines the factors contributing to the expulsions and humanizes the problem with numerous real-life stories&nbsp;about the experiences of individuals affected by what is considered a symptom of an overburdened and undervalued early education system.</p>



<p>“The main goal of this book is to keep the conversation front and center and keep us from collectively wiping our hands of the crisis. The exclusion of young children is harmful to our larger society, and we all have a role to play in ending the practice,” said Zinsser, UIC associate professor of psychology and principal investigator at the <a href="http://www.setllab.com">Social-Emotional Teaching and Learning Lab</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/kate-zinsser-uic-associate-professor-of-psychology/"><img loading="lazy" width="271" height="406" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kate-Zinsser-BW_4x6-271x406.jpg" alt="Kate Zinsser, UIC associate professor of psychology" class="wp-image-135503" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kate-Zinsser-BW_4x6-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kate-Zinsser-BW_4x6-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kate-Zinsser-BW_4x6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kate-Zinsser-BW_4x6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kate-Zinsser-BW_4x6-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kate-Zinsser-BW_4x6-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kate-Zinsser-BW_4x6.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a><figcaption>Kate Zinsser, UIC associate professor of psychology.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“No Longer Welcome” describes various personal, academic and community implications of early expulsions; why significant disparities exist and persist; and promising policies, practices and interventions.</p>



<p>Disciplinary decisions and responses to children’s behaviors are influenced by a mixture of factors, including individual and societal prejudices and biases; teachers’ own emotional health and well-being; whether and how teachers and schools form relationships with families; how early childhood programs support and compensate teachers; and policies and funding requirements that regulate interactions and resources.</p>



<p>One concern is that the children who are expelled for developmentally typical misbehavior or noncompliance are most often the ones in need of the enhanced social and emotional support and learning that is foundational to early childhood education. According to Zinsser, failure to properly support and retain children in early learning settings will result in more considerable strain on K–12 school systems to address children’s social, emotional and behavioral needs.</p>



<p>“While research has shown that children who have been excluded are also at higher risk for future exclusions, we can expect the long-term impacts to be significant and to affect not just the child but their families and communities,” Zinsser said.</p>



<p>Even with substantial progress toward identifying plausible interventions, she notes that a consensus about appropriate measures remains elusive and more work covering the long-term consequences of the expulsions is needed.</p>

<p>The event, which is scheduled for Sept. 10, 2-4 p.m., will be held at the Canalport Riverwalk Park, 2900 S. Ashland Ave. Admission is free and open to the public. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/river-of-welcomerio-de-bienvenida-tickets-403147895207?aff=ebdssbeac">Advanced online registration is required</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to offering a platform to share ideas for a new welcoming metal and mosaic sculpture at the park, River of Welcome/Rio de Bienvenida features family-friendly activities including aquatic ecosystem and urban river education with <a href="https://www.sheddaquarium.org/">Shedd Aquarium</a>; making and spreading seed bombs, which are native plant seeds and mushroom compost packed in clay, with <a href="https://www.urbanriv.org/">Urban Rivers</a>; hands-on art projects with the Chicago Public Art Group; screen printing with William Estrada of the <a href="https://werdmvmntstudios.com/section/431431-Mobile-Street-Art-Cart-Project.html">Mobile Street Art Cart Project</a>; and an organized park clean-up with <a href="https://www.chicagoriver.org/">Friends of the Chicago River</a>.</p>



<p>In July, the Freshwater Lab and the Chicago Public Art Group were named co-recipients of a $70,000 grant from <a href="https://earthartchicago.org/grant-awards-announcement/">E(art)H Chicago (Earth Art Chicago)</a>, for the sculpture at the riverwalk, which is situated in an underutilized 5-acre park and connects several communities, including Pilsen and Bridgeport.</p>



<p>The project’s proposed art installation, which will require Chicago Park District approval, aims to bring attention to the environmental racism and lack of green space in neighborhoods near the juncture of the south branch of the Chicago River, the Sanitary and Ship Canal, and Bubbly Creek.</p>



<p>“We will create designs that symbolize their hopes and visions for a future with cleaner air and water and create access to green space. We see this collaborative art process as an opportunity to engage community members in conversations and design discussions around how to make the park more welcoming and accessible, through this gateway art piece and beyond this project,” said Cynthia Weiss, the project’s lead artist.</p>



<p>Weiss is teamed on the project with fellow Chicago Public Art Group artist Delilah Salgado, in partnership with Citlalli Trujillo ​and Rachel Havrelock, both from the Freshwater Lab at UIC.</p>



<p>Future elements of the project include a workshop where participants will be invited to reflect on water, the environment and current environmental threats in their communities; a series of design and art-making workshops to create components of the actual artwork, such as images or panels using mosaics; and a celebratory event along the river once the artwork is completed.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">National data has consistently shown that Indigenous people in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are two to three times more likely to die from injury than non-Indigenous people. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, very little research has been done by the public or private sectors on the occupational hazards Indigenous people face, according to a new University of Illinois Chicago study published in </span><span data-contrast="auto">the <a href="https://oem.bmj.com/content/79/9/577">British Medical Journal of Occupational Health and Medicine</a></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Brett Shannon and Lee Friedman of the UIC School of Public Health examined research evaluating both Indigenous workers and adult workplace injuries in the four countries since 1970. After examining more than 1,500 peer-reviewed studies that met basic search criteria, they found only 51 studies featuring Indigenous occupational health data published in the last 50 years. Roughly half had been published after 2010. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Half of the studies reported higher rates of workplace injury or illness for Indigenous people compared with non-Indigenous people, with the greatest differences observed in farming injuries, workplace violence, work injuries requiring hospitalization and fatal injuries. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">None of the studies explored how environmental hazards at work impacted Indigenous people with chronic conditions like diabetes or asthma. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Only 13 of the 51 studies focused on Indigenous people exclusively. The majority of papers identified Indigenous people as a subset of a larger sample of workers. In nearly half the publications, the number of Indigenous people studied was less than 100, and only seven of the scholarly articles had an Indigenous author. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“There’s so little information,” said Shannon, a UIC doctoral candidate and descendent of the Australian Ngugi people. “If someone has diabetes or chronic heart disease, they’re at risk of poorer outcomes without medical intervention following a work injury. And there’s psychosocial factors that require consideration as well.&#8221;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">He noted that only one of the studies focused on occupational injuries that were psychological, revealing a failure to meet the holistic definition of health and well-being set by many Indigenous communities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The UIC study made recommendations for increasing research on the occupational health of Indigenous people, so that strategies for preventing death and injury can be developed. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A major challenge to understanding Indigenous occupational health is that employers and workplace insurers do not share consistent ways of identifying Indigenous workers in their record-keeping. Notable exceptions Friedman and Shannon found included New Zealand and the Canadian province of British Columbia, where workers’ compensation data systematically identified Indigenous people and was easily accessible for occupational health research.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Another challenge is that Indigenous people themselves do not always have the resources and incentives to lead research and data collection. However, Shannon has been working with Indigenous leaders and occupational health professionals from all four countries to develop best practices for capturing data and for promoting occupational health research as a profession. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">He is also helping Indigenous students at UIC, one of the most diverse universities in the U.S., to advocate for themselves. He and fellow doctoral student Zoë Harris, a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, will hold the first meeting of the </span><a href="https://today.uic.edu/indigenous-graduate-student-association-launches-this-fall/"><span data-contrast="auto">Indigenous Graduate Student Association</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> on campus this month.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The study, </span><a href="https://oem.bmj.com/content/79/9/577"><span data-contrast="auto">“Systematic scoping review of occupational health illnesses and injuries among Indigenous workers</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> is published in </span><span data-contrast="auto">the <a href="https://oem.bmj.com/">British Medical Journal of Occupational Health and Medicine</a></span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span></p>

<p>The University of Illinois Chicago Library was awarded a $250,000 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/jung-mi-scoulas-phdassistant-professor-and-assessment-coordina"><img loading="lazy" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jung-Mi-Scoulas-PhD_4x6-271x406.jpg" alt="Jung Mi Scoulas, PhD Assistant Professor and Assessment Coordinator University Library" class="wp-image-134834" width="142" height="213" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jung-Mi-Scoulas-PhD_4x6-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jung-Mi-Scoulas-PhD_4x6-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jung-Mi-Scoulas-PhD_4x6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jung-Mi-Scoulas-PhD_4x6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jung-Mi-Scoulas-PhD_4x6-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jung-Mi-Scoulas-PhD_4x6-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jung-Mi-Scoulas-PhD_4x6.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 142px) 100vw, 142px" /></a><figcaption>Jung Mi Scoulas, PhD </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The grant aims to develop assessment tools that utilize information such as students’ academic engagement, psychological factors and their own perspectives of success to identify activities that can be promoted to students to support their academic achievement.</p>



<p>UIC&#8217;s award is one of 71 awards, totaling more than $21 million, issued in fiscal year 2022 to libraries and archives across the country through the Institute of Museum and Library Services National Leadership Grants for Libraries program and the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program.</p>



<p>For this grant, UIC will conduct research to answer questions about student success that go beyond learning analytics and how library use plays a role in student success. The tools and research findings from this project will be disseminated to academic libraries to help them assess their impact on student success and to identify how libraries can better meet students’ needs.</p>



<p>The two-year project is a collaboration between the UIC Library and the library at Northern Illinois University – two institutions that serve underrepresented and first-generation students. </p>

<p>&#8220;We are grateful to have received an IMLS National Leadership Grant. With this funding, we have an opportunity to better understand specifics about how race, class and economic status impact our students as they pursue their educational goals. Our project is unique in that it considers students&#8217; actual lived experiences and asks the students themselves to define what success means to them. With this knowledge, we can individualize the services, resources and support we provide to better meet student needs and then share what we&#8217;ve learned with other academic libraries and institutions,” said Rhea Ballard-Thrower, UIC Dean of Libraries.</p>



<p>The principal investigator and project director is Jung Mi Scoulas, PhD and an assistant professor and assessment coordinator at the UIC Library. A co-principal investigator for the project is Sandra De Groote, professor and head of UIC’s assessment and scholarly communication department. NIU library faculty Nestor Osorio, head of reference and research, and Kimberly Shotick, student success librarian, will coordinate the study among NIU students.</p>

<p>While scientists have hoped that rechargeable zinc-manganese dioxide batteries could be developed into a viable alternative for grid storage applications, engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago and their colleagues&nbsp;identified the atomistic mechanism of&nbsp;charge and discharge&nbsp;in&nbsp;such batteries.</p>



<p>The scientists reached this conclusion after leveraging advanced electron microscopy, electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations to look closer at how the zinc anode works with the manganese cathode in the battery system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their findings are reported today in Nature Sustainability.</p>



<p>“Zinc and manganese separately have very favorable properties for high-quality sustainable batteries; however, when paired in a full system their intercalation — their rechargeability — has been debatable, with some recent studies suggesting zinc insertion and deinsertion in manganese dioxide is responsible for the rechargeability of the cells,” said study lead author Reza Shahbazian-Yassar, UIC professor of mechanical and industrial engineering in the College of Engineering. “With this study, we showed there is actually no microscopic evidence of zinc reinsertion into manganese dioxide, and what was previously thought to be indicators of recharging was from positively charged hydrogen ions being inserted in the manganese, not zinc.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their experiments, the researchers built aqueous zinc-manganese dioxide cells and tested them over 100 cycles. They discharged and attempted to recharge the batteries in experiments while using electron microscopy to capture atomic-level images of the reactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We saw that the hydrogen is responsible for the damage to the tunnel structures of manganese dioxide, further reducing the potential of the battery for recharging,” Shahbazian-Yassar said. “The information we’ve obtained with these experiments reveals important atomic insights into the mechanisms of the zinc-manganese battery. Now that we know what is happening at the cell level, we have a compass for finding better strategies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shahbazian-Yassar said different cell structures could make the system more favorable for zinc insertion or maybe strategies to harness the hydrogen protons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, titled “<a href="https://rdcu.be/cTg2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Understanding intercalation chemistry for sustainable aqueous zinc-manganese dioxide batteries</a>,” is co-authored by Yifei Yuan, Kun He, Mahmoud Tamadoni Saray, Wentao Yao and Meng Cheng from UIC; and Ryan Sharpe, Chenghang Li, Tongchao Liu, Hule Kin, Shun Wang, Khalil Amine, M. Saiful Islam and Jun Lu from partner institutions. Partner institutions include Wenzhou University, the University of Bath, Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Oxford.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[UIC awarded $3M NIH grant to establish a center for antiviral drug development]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago are working with the National Institutes of Health and researchers from across the country to establish a center for antiviral drug development for pandemic-level viruses, including Ebola and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The center, called the Midwest Antiviral Drug Discovery Center, is led by the University of Minnesota and is part of <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-announces-antiviral-drug-development-awards"><span class="s1">a network of nine national centers established by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</span></a> in response to the public health emergency caused by COVID-19. The project is funded with an initial three-year grant and an anticipated extension to five years that would include additional funding.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/lijun-rong-4"><img loading="lazy" width="271" height="406" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RongLijun18-271x406.jpg" alt="Lijun Rong" class="wp-image-39813" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RongLijun18-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RongLijun18-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RongLijun18-600x900.jpg 600w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RongLijun18-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RongLijun18.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a><figcaption>Lijun Rong, UIC professor of microbiology and immunology.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The center brings together collaborative investigators from 16 institutions nationwide to discover effective responses to pandemics, life-threatening infections and drug resistance through basic, translational and clinical research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UIC will receive approximately $3 million for the research with the University of Minnesota and will focus on developing an antiviral therapy for filoviruses, like Ebola.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lijun Rong, professor of microbiology and immunology, will lead the UIC research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our lab uses high throughput screening to perform large-scale experiments and generate large sets of data to identify the viral protein targets, which are used by viruses&nbsp;to enter human cells and replicate. We have screened several small molecule libraries and have identified many potent inhibitors against filoviruses, arenaviruses, influenza viruses, henipavirus, HIV and SARS2,” Rong said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rong’s lab, in partnership with Chicago BioSolutions, a startup company, and other researchers at UIC, has developed a potential antiviral for Ebola and will use the funding to further develop and test this therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic has opened the public’s eye about the dangers of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, and this funding mechanism and research is critical in becoming better armed to combat the impact of these pathogens in the future,” Rong said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rong is hopeful that within the next three to five years the drug will be ready for testing in humans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with Rong on the research at UIC are Irina Gaisina, Terry Moore, Michael Caffrey and Laura Cooper. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to UIC and the University of Minnesota, other collaborating institutions on the Midwest Antiviral Drug Discovery Center grant (1U19AI171954) include Baylor College of Medicine, Boston University, Georgia State University, Iowa State University, Nanyang Technological University Singapore, New York Blood Center, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, UF Scripps Biomedical Research, University of California Berkeley, University of California San Diego, University of Iowa, University of Louisville, University of Tennessee Health Science Center and University of Texas Health San Antonio. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a 2016 campaign stop in Iowa, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pronounced, &#8220;I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn&#8217;t lose any voters, OK?&#8221;</p>

<p>Was he right?&nbsp;Or do some transgressions cross a line in the sand — points that, if crossed, cause voters to abandon their support?</p>



<p>And if there are lines in the sand, do conservatives and liberals draw them in the same place? Does the strength of ideological identity affect where people draw the line?</p>



<p>These sociopolitical issues are illuminated in &#8220;Could Your Candidate Shoot Someone on 5th Avenue and not Lose Votes? Identifying &#8216;Lines in the Sand&#8217; in Ingroup Candidate Transgressions,&#8221; a new study published in the <a href="https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/5453">Journal of Social and Political Psychology</a> that explores how people make voting decisions when they learn their favored candidates have committed moral transgressions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers from the University of Illinois Chicago created a scale of 70 different transgressions, such as stealing $1,000 or committing tax fraud, that continuously increased in severity.&nbsp; As part of the study, participants had to make a series of voting decisions where they decided to vote for either a fictional in-group candidate or an outgroup candidate to be elected into the House of Representatives. In each of these 70 voting trials, participants learned their in-group candidate committed a transgression, ranging from mild to highly severe.</p>



<p>“By creating this multi-trial design, we were able to determine that people tended to abandon favored candidates when they learned the candidate was involved in acts of theft over $10,000, and acts where an innocent person was physically harmed and required extensive treatment,” said Kathryn Howard, UIC doctoral candidate in psychology and lead author of the report.</p>



<p>Significant ideological differences between Republicans and Democrats also stood out. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Republicans were more likely than their political counterparts to maintain support of their candidate even after learning of transgressions of rather high severity, such as “paid a witness to give false testimony in a criminal trial,” the report states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants who strongly identified with their own personal ideology were also more likely to vote for transgressive candidates. On average, people possessed more than a 50% chance of voting for candidates who committed crimes, such as smuggling drugs into the country for resale.</p>



<p>Howard noted these tendencies likely affect which political candidates get elected into office.</p>



<p>“Some election outcomes may be the result of conservatives and liberals voting differently when they learn of in-group candidate transgressions,” she said.</p>



<p>Co-authors of the study are Daniel Cervone, UIC professor of psychology, and Matt Motyl of Civil Politics.</p>

<p>Results from a pilot clinical trial show that among a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of adults who were obese and depressed, an integrated behavioral intervention was more effective than usual care at reducing depression and associated anxiety symptoms than it was at promoting weight loss. </p>



<p>Using functional brain imaging, the University of Illinois Chicago researchers who led the study also found that among those participating in the intervention, neural processes involved in cognitive control changed and were predictive of anxiety symptom reductions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the UIC researchers think the timing of the trial — which overlapped with the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from March to August 2020 — may have impacted the weight loss results, they say the positive effects on depression and anxiety symptoms and correlation with specific neural processes are evidence of the effectiveness and potential underlying mechanism of the integrated behavioral intervention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The link between our brain and behavior is powerful, and this growing body of evidence shows us that whole-person, integrated behavioral therapy can offer hope for some of our most challenging health conditions — obesity and depression, for example, being both highly prevalent and notoriously tricky to treat,” said study lead author Dr. Jun Ma, the Beth and George Vitoux Professor of Medicine and director of Vitoux Program on Aging and Prevention at the UIC College of Medicine. </p>



<p>A new paper in Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science describes the findings of the study, which enrolled more than 100 people from UIC and its health system and randomly assigned them to receive either usual care or the intervention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The majority of study participants were women (76%) around 47 years old, and more than two-thirds self-identified as Black (55%) or Latino (20%).&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-researcher-to-test-voice-activated-ai-to-manage-mental-health-symptoms/dr-jun_ma-290x406-1"><img loading="lazy" width="290" height="406" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dr.-Jun_Ma-290x406-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-100334" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dr.-Jun_Ma-290x406-1.jpg 290w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Dr.-Jun_Ma-290x406-1-184x258.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></a><figcaption>Dr. Jun Ma. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Participants who received usual care (35 participants) were advised to continue routine medical care and were provided with a summary of behavioral health and weight management services, as well as a wearable activity tracker. Participants who participated in the integrated behavioral intervention (71 participants) received therapy from a trained health coach and a weight loss video program. The therapy involved a seven-step problem-solving and behavioral activation strategy, delivered as first-line treatment, along with antidepressant medications as needed for depression management. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The weight loss video program was adapted from the highly successful Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention, which Ma previously demonstrated was effective in obese patients without depression. The integrated intervention is innovative because it combines problem-solving therapy and the weight loss video program, given that obesity is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that clinical improvements in anxiety were preceded by changes in activation and connectivity improvements in brain regions involved in emotion regulation and furthermore are targeted by treatments like repetitive transcranial stimulation and cognitive behavioral therapy,” said Dr. Olusola Ajilore, associate professor of psychiatry and a co-first author of the study&nbsp;</p>



<p>Symptoms of depression were assessed with a 20-item symptom checklist and symptoms of anxiety through a seven-item scale, and weight was measured by research staff. Baseline results were compared with six-month results. Brain activity was measured with functional MRI in response to research standardized photos of threatening, sad or happy faces, for example, at baseline and two months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A significantly higher percentage of participants in the intervention group compared with usual care group achieved remission of depressive symptoms (43% vs. 22%) and anxiety symptoms (63% vs. 39%) at six months, but percentages of participants achieving 3% or 5% weight loss at six months did not differ significantly by group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anxiety score changes significantly correlated with brain activity changes in specific regions of the prefrontal cortex that are responsible for cognitive control, and the correlations differed between the intervention and usual care groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Taken together, these and our previous results imply the potential for enhancing the innovative integrated behavioral intervention we developed with other treatment strategies targeted at the specific regions of the brain involved in cognition and emotion regulation in order to combat obesity and depression and anxiety,” Ma said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leanne Williams of Stanford University is also a principal investigator and senior author of the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago have been awarded just over $1 million from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Alliance for Water Innovation to build a system that selectively removes and destroys poly- and perfluorinated substances, commonly called PFAS and referred to as “forever chemicals,” from industrial and municipal wastewaters. PFAS are man-made chemicals found in many common materials, and the grant will support the team’s work for three years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to widespread use in industrial settings, fertilizers and commercial products that end up in landfills, PFAS seep into groundwater and drinking water supplies. Unfortunately, these ubiquitous “forever chemicals” do not break down in the body and are linked to harmful health effects in humans and animals. Evidence shows that at low levels the compounds can lead to high cholesterol and cancer and have effects on the reproductive and immune system and thyroid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UIC team, led by Brian Chaplin, professor of chemical engineering, will develop a prototype of their system and, at the end of the three-year funding, deploy it for scale-up and pilot testing in California’s Orange County Water District. In the county, frequent droughts mean that the utility is investing in new technology to increase the county’s problematic drinking water supply through water recycling and aquifer recharge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chaplin’s system works through a treatment process called reactive electrochemical membrane filtration. As the water passes through the REM system, adsorbents and catalysts on the membrane trap and destroy PFAS, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the funding, the UIC team will develop, screen, characterize and optimize efficient electrocatalysts so that the system is successful at removing and, notably, destroying PFAS at high levels with low energy consumption. They will also analyze other systems for comparison and best practices in deploying the technology at a large scale in practical, real-world applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While REM filtration is one of the only ways to destroy PFAS, these systems so far work best in a limited number of controlled conditions. Our challenge is to make these systems work in the environment,” Chaplin said. “When we complete this work, this new technology will be ready to be piloted in the industrial and municipal wastewater sectors, which will help us and other practitioners evaluate its impact on facilitating desalination and recycling of nontraditional water streams.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chaplin hopes the development of new catalyst materials will operationalize the system for successful destructive removal of PFAS in under two minutes of contact time and with a conversion rate of less than 10 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter, which is an order of magnitude lower than other destructive technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“PFAS contamination is a widespread problem in our industrial society, and unless we can find successful ways to destroy these forever chemicals, the potential adverse health effects will continue to grow as the substances accumulate in the environment,” Chaplin said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with Chaplin on the project are Sangil Kim, associate professor of chemical engineering; Ahmed Abokifa, assistant professor of civil, materials and environmental engineering; and scientists from Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University, and other industrial collaborators, who also received funding for the project.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago have been awarded approximately $3.3 million from the National Institute on Aging to study telehealth behavioral interventions among adults 50 and older with excess weight and cardiometabolic risk factors.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}"> </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The study investigators from UIC, Washington University and the University of Pittsburgh hope to enroll more than 1,000 patients in the multisite clinical trial, which will deliver the behavioral interventions primarily through the interactive patient portal of the electronic health record system used at each university’s health system.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}"> </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“This will be one of the largest clinical trials to test behavioral weight loss interventions that are fully remote and integrated into the electronic health record, which is critically important in real-world health care delivery,” said UIC’s Dr. Jun Ma, the contact principal investigator of the multisite study.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">The study will use an adaptive treatment model, in which participants are randomized to receive one of two behavioral interventions. One is the base intervention that uses an evidence-based weight loss video program consisting of 12 videos, each 20-25 minutes long. The other intervention augments the video program with problem-solving therapy delivered via videoconferencing by a trained health coach.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">In the trial’s adaptive treatment model, participants randomized to the base intervention will begin the video program immediately or after a 12-week waiting period. Participants randomized to the augmented intervention will receive problem-solving coaching at the same time as starting the video program or only if they do not achieve at least 3% weight loss after using the video program for six weeks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}"> </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“This innovative adaptive treatment design will help us to understand which patients need which interventions at what time,” said Ma, the Beth and George Vitoux Professor of Medicine and director of Vitoux Program on Aging and Prevention at the UIC College of Medicine.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">“This design will inform clinical care delivery,” Ma said. “The study will provide data on which patients who already receive an evidence-based weight loss video program will benefit from adding the health coach-delivered problem-solving therapy, and at what time should this treatment augmentation take place, rather than assuming that this more cost- and time-intensive intervention is needed for everyone at all times. The design of this trial allows us to do more than compare one intervention to another. It helps us understand better how to tailor treatments based on patients’ early weight loss. In addition, we will apply machine learning methods and predictive analytics to study outcome prediction for the behavioral interventions.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}"> </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">To enroll participants, the researchers will check the electronic health record for eligibility criteria, like height and weight and diagnoses such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol. Once consented and randomized into the study, participants will receive the weight loss video program through the patient portal of their electronic health record. Those assigned to also receive problem-solving therapy will have telehealth appointments with a health coach via videoconferencing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}"> </span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Participants’ physical activity and weight will be tracked with wearable devices and wireless scales provided by the study, and participants will also be provided with a tablet to ensure access to the patient portal and telehealth coaching.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">“Ultimately, we hope to identify effective integrated behavioral interventions to help people reduce their risk of cardiometabolic diseases,” Ma said.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="none">Along with Ma, UIC’s Dr. Rachel Caskey, associate professor of medicine and pediatrics and head of internal medicine and geriatrics, and Dr. Jonathan Radosta, associate professor of internal medicine and interim chief medical officer at UI Health, UIC’s health system, will lead the UIC site for the clinical trial. Elizabeth Venditti, associate professor of psychiatry and epidemiology, will lead the study at the University of Pittsburgh and Thomas Kannampallil, associate professor of anesthesiology, will lead the study at Washington University. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:2,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:300}"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[UIC leads initiative in partnership with four Chicago area university research centers ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A multidisciplinary team representing five Chicago-area university research centers will unite as part of a new data science institute backed by a five-year, $10 million grant from the National Science Foundation.</p>



<p>The grant merges two existing collaborative institutes, the Foundations of Data Science and the Institute for Data, Econometrics, Algorithms and Learning, to form a new research group that uses the IDEAL name. It is being funded through phase two of the NSF Harnessing the Data Revolution initiative and follows a competitive proposal process involving institutes funded during phase one.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/lev-reyzin-uic-professor-of-mathematics-statistics-and-compute"><img loading="lazy" width="271" height="406" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lev-Reyzin-profile_4x6-271x406.jpg" alt="Lev Reyzin, UIC professor of mathematics, statistics and computer science." class="wp-image-133316" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lev-Reyzin-profile_4x6-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lev-Reyzin-profile_4x6-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lev-Reyzin-profile_4x6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lev-Reyzin-profile_4x6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lev-Reyzin-profile_4x6.jpg 1200w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lev-Reyzin-profile_4x6-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lev-Reyzin-profile_4x6-1000x1500.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a><figcaption>Lev Reyzin, UIC professor of mathematics, statistics and computer science.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Leading the effort is the University of Illinois Chicago in partnership with the Illinois Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago and the University of Chicago. The institute will have 55 faculty members from the five institutions, in addition to nine researchers from Google.</p>



<p>IDEAL will support work focused on three themes: foundations of machine learning, high-dimensional data analysis and inference, and data science and society. Computer science, electrical engineering, probability and statistics are among the core disciplines represented in the project.</p>



<p>“A unique aspect of our institute is that we will bring in other areas not traditionally represented in data science, including mathematical logic, economics and law,” said Lev Reyzin, a principal investigator and UIC professor of mathematics, statistics and computer science. “One of the goals of this institute is to create a cohesive data science community within the Chicago area.”</p>



<p>The research programs under IDEAL will address issues from deep learning and optimization and networks and statistical inference to networks and statistical inference and privacy and fairness.</p>



<p>IDEAL also aims to broaden participation in data science, help develop future workforce members and connect with the local community through lectures at high schools, exhibits at the Museum of Science and Industry and teacher workshops.</p>



<p>UIC students will benefit from the project through access to research assistantships, postdoctoral fellowships, cross-institutional courses, workshops and seminars.</p>



<p>“They will get to interact with institute visitors. We will also develop new courses that they can take at UIC,” Reyzin said.</p>



<p>The institute&#8217;s inaugural director will be Avrim Blum from ToyotaTechnological Institute, followed by Aravindan Vijayaraghavan of Northwestern, and then Reyzin of UIC.</p>



<p>Co-principal investigators from UIC include Natasha Devroye, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering; Will Perkins, assistant professor of mathematics, statistics and computer science; Yichao Wu, the TransUnion Professor based in the department of mathematics, statistics and computer science; and Elena Zheleva, UIC assistant professor of computer science.</p>

<p class="p1">Chemical engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago are investigating new methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cement manufacturing.</p>



<p class="p2">Cement is one of the most widely used building materials, but its production is responsible for up to 8% of global emissions from carbon dioxide, representing a major challenge to the goal of reducing climate change. Despite ongoing efforts to research renewable energy options and new cementation methods, there is currently no clear pathway to carbon-neutral cement manufacturing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>



<p class="p2">Now, thanks to two federal grant awards, UIC researchers and their collaborators from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Pennsylvania State University are hoping to change this fact.</p>



<p class="p2">“We have a global problem with C02 emissions, and if you look at all the industrial processes and rank them from highest to the lowest in terms of producing C02, cement manufacturing is at the top,” said Meenesh Singh, assistant professor of chemical engineering at the UIC College of Engineering. “We cannot just stop using it because cement is so crucial for creating buildings, infrastructures, roads and many other places.”</p>



<p class="p2">One award, from the Department of Energy, will provide $2.3 million in support of research to develop a carbon-negative replacement for portland cement, the most commonly used type of cement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="p2">“We hope to turn the widely used and previously carbon-intensive building material into a carbon capture system,” said Singh, co-principal investigator of the DOE award.</p>



<p class="p2">The funding is awarded through the <a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/programs/hestia"><span class="s1">Harnessing Emissions into Structures Taking Inputs from the Atmosphere</span></a> program, which was created to support the development of technologies that cancel out embodied emissions while transforming buildings into net carbon storage structures.</p>



<p class="p2">Singh’s research group will collaborate with scientists from UW-Madison and Penn State on the grant. The proposed project from the three universities uses carbon captured from the air through a process called distributed direct air capture with rapid mineral carbonation to convert industrial mineral wastes such as coal ash into a recyclable replacement for portland cement. The objective is to create a durable and versatile building material that permanently stores C02 through a process that pulls more carbon out of the air than is emitted.</p>



<p class="p2">“What we have done with this idea is take a waste material that we then make into a castable cement-like material, which does not release C02 but actually captures it,” Singh said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="p2">UIC is working on a high-throughput system that can test different types and levels of chemicals, which can be used with varied waste materials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="p2">Another award, $1.9 million from the National Science Foundation to UIC, UW-Madison and Fort Lewis College, will support the development of a sustainable way to produce calcium hydroxide, a critical ingredient for creating cement.</p>



<p class="p2">The process under development is known as LoTECH, for low-temperature calcium hydroxide process. It uses a low-temperature ammonia cycle to produce calcium hydroxide from industrial waste streams, such as crushed concrete and coal ashes. As a result, cement could be made into concrete in small, distributed plants or portable units, Singh said.</p>



<p class="p2">The LoTECH system also has potential to shorten supply chains and promote sustainability in the concrete industry, he said.</p>



<p class="p2">“You can think of this as a closed-looped, modular process,” said Singh, co-principal investigator of the NSF award. “It can be placed in the back of a truck, and wherever you have a supply of concrete after a building is demolished, this system can harvest the waste product and then manufacture new cement right on site.”</p>



<p class="p2">Singh added that sustainable calcium hydroxide could replace the traditionally used limestone as the calcium source, which offers a realistic way to quickly lower the carbon footprint of the existing cement industry by more than 50% by eliminating the thermal decomposition of limestone.</p>

<p>In anticipation of July 29 marking Rodolfo “Rudy” Lozano Day in Cook County, the University of Illinois Chicago Library is announcing that a digital exhibit celebrating the Pilsen activist, labor organizer and UIC alumnus is available to the public.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://exhibits.library.uic.edu/lozano">digital exhibit</a> shows a portion of the physical exhibit currently on display at UIC’s Richard J. Daley Library, “A Search for Unity: Rudy Lozano and Coalition Building in Chicago,” which will run through the fall, said David Greenstein, lecturer in special collections and university archives.</p>



<p>The exhibit is made up of papers, photographs, posters and other memories about Lozano, who was murdered June 8, 1983, when he was 31. Greenstein curated the exhibit with Peggy Glowacki, former manuscripts librarian, and Elena Bulgarella, assistant archivist.</p>



<p>The digital exhibit has more than 50 documents, including photos, campaign posters, flyers and other artifacts from the Rudy Lozano papers and related collections, which are housed in the library archives. Also available online is a newly digitized video of a speech he gave at a 1979 May Day rally.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/community-activist-rodolfo-rudy-lozano-who-attended-university-3"><img loading="lazy" width="271" height="406" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LOZA12_0006_0058_0001_4x6-271x406.jpg" alt="Community activist Rodolfo &quot;Rudy&quot; Lozano who attended University" class="wp-image-126815" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LOZA12_0006_0058_0001_4x6-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LOZA12_0006_0058_0001_4x6-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LOZA12_0006_0058_0001_4x6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LOZA12_0006_0058_0001_4x6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LOZA12_0006_0058_0001_4x6.jpg 1200w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LOZA12_0006_0058_0001_4x6-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/LOZA12_0006_0058_0001_4x6-1000x1500.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a><figcaption>Community activist Rudy Lozano, who attended the University of Illinois Chicago in the 1970s. (Photo: Rodolfo &#8220;Rudy&#8221; Lozano archives)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>&#8220;Anybody can access the digitized documents, films and other materials that are part of that exhibit,” said Greenstein, adding that the text of the exhibit is available in Spanish as well as in English.</p>



<p>Lozano, who was born in Harlingen, Texas, to Mexican immigrant parents, was gunned down in 1983 months after losing a bid to become Chicago’s first Mexican American alderman. According to news accounts, Lozano failed to force an aldermanic runoff by only 17 votes but managed to get enough Latino voters to support Harold Washington’s successful bid to become Chicago’s first Black mayor.</p>



<p>Greenstein said the exhibit honors Lozano, who attended UIC in the 1970s and who was part of a student movement advocating for the university to recruit more Latino students and reshape the university’s curriculum to teach Latino studies. In addition, the movement was calling for a cultural center to serve the community on campus.</p>



<p>Lozano’s widow, Lupe, said she and her family are honored and thankful that the library chose to have the exhibit so that the UIC community and others can learn about who her husband was and how he dedicated his life to “his vision for unity among all working people.”</p>



<p>“It’s extremely important for UIC students and really everyone young and old to understand how committed and dedicated my husband was to improve the lives of Latinos, undocumented immigrants and all working people,” Lupe Lozano said. “Rudy was focused on creating political coalitions among minority and historically disenfranchised communities, especially among Black and Brown, and white progressive allies.”</p>



<p>She said that at UIC, Lozano&#8217;s work, along with the work of other underrepresented activists, helped open doors for better access and opportunities in higher education in the city’s historically underrepresented communities. His fight successfully led to the creation of the Latin American Recruitment and Educational Services initiative as well as the Latino Cultural Center, she said.</p>

<p>Latinx students now make up the second-largest group of students on campus, and UIC is a Hispanic-Serving Institution as designated by the U.S. Department of Education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her husband’s legacy serves an example that young people are “the future generations of our society,” and they should know about their shared history and “homegrown heroes that fought” for current rights.</p>



<p>“My husband was a pioneer in realizing that for working-class communities to have equal opportunities in our society, it was going to take running our own independent and progressive thinking candidates in electoral politics. Those that look and talk like us, that come from where we come from and could finally represent our voices at the table for our people and so many underserved communities seeking lasting change, racial justice and equal rights — big and small,” said Lupe Lozano.</p>



<p>She is also thankful that Cook County officials last year decided to celebrate her husband’s legacy in perpetuity by declaring July 29 Rudy Lozano Day. In addition to that honor, he has a Chicago Public Library branch and several schools named after him.</p>



<p>“When my husband passed, I dedicated my life to ensuring his legacy and life&#8217;s work would be recognized and shared far and wide. It has been our aim that Rudy’s vision for hope, change and justice would never be forgotten,” said Lupe Lozano. “His legacy is a part of Chicago&#8217;s legacy. It&#8217;s the legacy of a grassroots resistance movement in the Midwest, and it&#8217;s the legacy of my sons, their families and the grandchildren of my husband and me.”</p>

<p>The University of Illinois Chicago&#8217;s Office of Community Relations has partnered with a Pilsen community organization to provide area youth ages 12 to 18 with access to swimming pools and athletic fields, combined with brief educational talks, during weekly visits to campus this summer.</p>



<p>The pilot program, called Summer of Fun @ UIC, will partner with <a href="https://luvcity.org/">Luv City</a>, a Chicago-based production company that gives at-risk youth a creative outlet to express themselves, along with coordination support from the offices of 25th Ward Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez, to provide transportation to and from the UIC Physical Education Building, where the facilities are housed. The program, scheduled to run July 5 through Aug. 9, will give Luv City participants safe and active enrichment options.</p>



<p>“Beyond access to swimming pools and athletics fields, we will also engage the youth with weekly talks that will focus on topics like financial awareness, mental health, artistic creativity and other areas tailored to their interests,” said Amalia Pallares, UIC vice chancellor for diversity, equity and engagement.&nbsp;“We view this pilot as an important resource for local youth as well as an expansion and deepening of our community collaborations and partnerships in Pilsen.”</p>



<p>Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez said the effort reflects the cooperation between UIC and the community.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our community has a responsibility to our youth, to guide them in the right direction in order to succeed,” said Ald. Sigcho-Lopez. “Thanks to UIC and Luv City for opening up the athletic fields and aquatic arenas for youth summer programs because investments in our children are investments in our future.”</p>



<p>The Summer of Fun @ UIC program is being sponsored in part by the R.R. Callahan Company, a property rental company that has supported youth programming in Pilsen over the years as part of its operations.</p>



<p>The Office of Diversity, Equity and Engagement includes UIC’s external outreach efforts led by&nbsp;<a href="https://communityrelations.uic.edu/">Community Relations</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://communitycollaboration.uic.edu/">Community Collaboration</a>, and Partnerships for Anti-Racist Campus Transformations, known as&nbsp;<a href="https://pact.uic.edu/">PACT</a>. The office drives all aspects of campuswide diversity and equity work, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/community/ccusc/">Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/about/advancing-racial-equity/">Advancing Racial Equity</a>&nbsp;initiatives and diversity educational programming.</p>

<p>The Portal Project of the Social Justice Initiative at the University of Illinois Chicago has received a $1.5 million grant to support its work to break down silos and collectively map visions for transformative change.</p>



<p>UIC is one of four recipients of the one-time grant by the Marguerite Casey Foundation, which announced a $6 million investment split among four organizations working toward bridging the worlds of social justice scholarship and social movements. The investments are aimed at shifting the balance of power in society to those who have long been excluded from having it.</p>



<p>The Portal Project <a href="https://today.uic.edu/collaborative-justice-centered-think-tank-launches-at-uic-the-social-justice-portal-project">launched in 2021</a>, focusing on three topic areas: abolition, economic democracy and climate justice. It will continue through the spring of 2023, culminating in a national conference and book publication.</p>



<p>“Over the past year, the Portal Project has convened nearly 200 scholars, artists and activists to explore the meaning of justice in the 21st century, centering those communities most impacted by various forms of injustice,” said Barbara Ransby, director of the Social Justice Initiative and founder of the Portal Project. “Through workshops, symposia and public forums, we have engaged a brilliant and eclectic group of thinkers and doers in conversations that wrestle with some of the most complex justice questions of our time.”</p>



<p>“This generous grant will allow us to deepen and expand our work in creative and meaningful ways,” said Ransby, the John D. MacArthur professor and chair in Black studies, gender and women&#8217;s studies, and history. “The Portal Project is not only an interdisciplinary, intergenerational site of new knowledge creation, but we also seek to make the collective insights produced through our work accessible to a wide and diverse public through books, graphics, videos and art exhibitions.”</p>



<p>“We believe that bold investments in ideas about how to shift power in society must be matched with bold investments in organizing efforts that help bring them to life,” said Carmen Rojas, president and CEO of the Marguerite Casey Foundation.</p>



<p>Critical to the foundation’s strategy is supporting leaders that are matching their ideas about how to shift power with efforts that put those ideas into action, Rojas said.</p>



<p>The Portal Project was inspired by the words of the acclaimed Indian writer Arundhati Roy, who reminds us that, historically, “pandemics are portals&#8221; and opportunities to embrace new ways of thinking and being. What often inhibits us from identifying the most creative and transformative solutions is that we operate in many stifling siloes based on disciplines, differences and areas of work.</p>



<p>Some of the scholars involved in the Portal Project have included: Angela Davis, political activist, philosopher, academic and author who has lectured around the world; UCLA Professor Robin D.G. Kelley, award-winning historian, essayist and scholar whose work focuses on labor, race and resistance; Princeton Professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, a MacArthur fellow and scholar of racial inequality in public policy, whose 2019 book “Race for Profit” was longlisted for a National Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in History; and Naomi Klein, a renowned author and journalist who has covered climate justice, activism, inequality, policy and politics.</p>



<p>The Marguerite Casey Foundation supports leaders, scholars and initiatives focused on shifting the balance of power in society — building power for communities that continue to be excluded from shaping how society works and from sharing in its rewards and freedoms. The foundation’s board members, leadership and staff are committed to building a just economy and fully realized democracy, and to providing unfettered support to the bold strategies that are required to bring about major change in our lifetime. Supporting scholarship, popular education and writing on justice themes is a critical part of that mission. In 2020 the foundation launched its Freedom Scholars Awards, and Ransby was an inaugural recipient.</p>

<p>In the largest epidemiologic study of arsenic and birth outcomes to date, researchers from the University of Illinois Chicago and collaborating institutions estimated arsenic levels in U.S. private well water sources by county and compared estimates to documented birth outcomes. They found an association between estimated groundwater arsenic concentration and risk of low birth weight.</p>



<p>The findings, which are reported in the journal Environment International, suggest that efforts to reduce arsenic in private wells could help more babies be born at healthy weights, particularly in rural areas.</p>



<p>Arsenic is a natural element that, in some forms, is highly toxic when consumed through contaminated water used for drinking, food preparation or crop irrigation. All public water systems in the U.S. are required to monitor arsenic levels, but private wells — which are used by 14% of people in the country — are unregulated. As a result, there is limited comprehensive data on the extent of arsenic contamination and associated health risks in the U.S.</p>

<p>“While we have known that arsenic is dangerous, this lack of data on exposures from private wells has left some U.S. communities disproportionately vulnerable to adverse health events from the contaminant,” said study co-author Maria Argos, associate professor of epidemiology and associate dean for global health at the UIC School of Public Health. “Developing a method to estimate these exposure risks was the first step in understanding the true exposure risk for all people living in the U.S.”</p>



<p>Using several machine learning algorithms, the researchers characterized the probability that specific ranges of arsenic concentration occurred in groundwater sources in nearly all 3,000-plus counties in the conterminous U.S.</p>



<p>&#8220;These machine learning models are based on data collected by the USGS from over 20,000 private wells located throughout the U.S.,” said Melissa Lombard, hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, who is also a co-author of the study. “The models allow us to estimate arsenic in areas where there are no data.&nbsp;The development of the models was a collaboration between hydrologists and epidemiologists to explore connections between arsenic exposure from drinking water and human health outcomes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Probabilistic model estimates and private well usage data were linked to all live birth certificates issued in 2016. The researchers compared the models to data on birth outcomes, which are tracked by public health departments, looking at gestational age and birth weight.</p>



<p>While there was no observed association in gestational age, there was an inverse association with birthweight, even at moderately low levels.</p>



<p>The model predicted that counties with a higher probability of private well arsenic concentrations exceeding 5 micrograms per liter were associated with a birth weight 1.8 grams lower than average. Similarly, counties with a higher probability that private well arsenic concentrations exceeded 10 micrograms per liter – the standard followed by the federal government – were associated with a 2.8-gram reduction in birth weight, compared to average.</p>



<p>The researchers said the association they found is somewhat limited because the analysis was based on estimates of exposures rather than individual-level measured exposures, but the limitations of their model may be an underestimate of the true association.</p>



<p>“Birth outcomes are an indicator of health and chronic disease risk throughout the lifespan, and the results of our study offer evidence that building awareness of exposures and expanding testing resources in communities that rely on private wells should be a public health priority,” Argos said.</p>



<p>The research was funded by the USGS John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis working group “<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/john-wesley-powell-center-for-analysis-and-synthesis/science/linking-environmental-and">Linking environmental and public health data to evaluate health effects of arsenic exposure from domestic and public supply wells</a>.”</p>

<h4 class="has-text-align-center">A multidisciplinary educator whose work spans two continents, Rodriguez will continue to advance the school&#8217;s mission and facilitate new dialogue across cultures and fields of design</h4>



<p>The School of Architecture at the University of Illinois Chicago announced today the appointment of Florencia Rodriguez as its new director. </p>



<p>For two decades, Rodriguez has practiced as an editor, writer and educator in both the United States and Argentina, creating bridges in architectural discourse between the Americas, as well as within the field. She comes to UIC from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where she was also a Loeb Fellow in 2013. She will assume the directorship in August 2022, pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.</p>



<p>In her new role, Rodriguez will continue to facilitate dialogue across cultures and disciplines in advancement of the school’s strong intellectual vision and commitment to the intersection of practice and theory.</p>



<p>As a multidisciplinary practitioner, Rodriguez brings a fresh perspective and entrepreneurial spirit to the School of Architecture. In 2010, Rodriguez founded PLOT, one of the leading design publications in Latin America. Through the U.S.-based publishing company Lots of Architecture Publishers, which she established in 2017, Rodriguez has edited numerous books, directed NESS — a periodical on architecture, life and urban culture — and spearheaded programming aimed at the dissemination of new narratives and the exploration of alternative forms of design criticism.</p>



<p>&#8220;With NESS, and previously Monte and PLOT, Florencia Rodriguez has demonstrated a significant ability and commitment to building forums focused on architecture as a cultural practice,” said David Brown, associate director of graduate affairs and the search committee’s co-chair. “Florencia is uniquely positioned to advance the School of Architecture’s mission to prepare graduates to negotiate and collaborate across various manifestations of design, and to generate ideas and systems with contemporary cultural and disciplinary resonance.”</p>



<p>Rodriguez’s intellectual contributions and dedication to training the next generation of designers have helped shape and propel important conversations in the field. Her recent book published by Actar D, “MCHAP The Americas 2: Territory &amp; Expeditions,” provides a set of lenses through which to examine the newest architecture of the Americas, and promotes new understandings about the relationship between architecture and its environment, as well as singularities and genealogies of the region’s most prominent works. Rodriguez has received several awards for her editorial work, which has also appeared in publications such as Domus, Oris, summa+, Arquine and Uncube.</p>



<p>Under outgoing director Robert Somol’s extraordinary leadership, the School of Architecture has had a transformative impact on international architecture education as an “incubator of new ideas” premised on architecture as a projective cultural practice.</p>



<p>“Florencia Rodriguez is a creative powerhouse with a brilliant design sensibility who will build on this strong foundation and who will work collaboratively with our world-class faculty to propel the school to even greater accomplishments,” said Rebecca Rugg, dean of the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts. “Additionally, as a trained architect and educator whose work spans two continents, Florencia is representative of the diverse perspectives and cultures that shape the School of Architecture’s incredible student body, and that inspire and inform UIC’s progressive outlook.”</p>



<p>“I am thrilled to be joining the School of Architecture at UIC,” Rodriguez said. “I have long admired the School of Architecture’s commitment to a curriculum that fuses theory, technology and rigorous research in a way that encourages students to approach architectural ideas with fresh eyes and a deep sense of purpose. I look forward to advancing this vision and adapting it to reflect the ever-shifting cultural, political and economic realities of contemporary society.”</p>



<p>As director, Rodriguez will work closely with the dean of the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts, and the School of Architecture faculty, staff and administration, on all aspects of the school’s operation. Her role will also include fostering and strengthening relationships both within and outside the field that promote the school’s pursuit to liberate and install new forms of collective association and material arrangement through all media of architectural design and research.</p>

<p>Two exhibitions examining issues of immigration, (dis)location and belonging are on view at Gallery 400 on the University of Illinois Chicago campus through Aug. 6.</p>



<p>The exhibits, Nadav Assor’s and Tirtza Even’s &#8220;Chronicle of a Fall&#8221; and the group video exhibition &#8220;A Species of Theft,&#8221; are free and open to the public.</p>



<p>&#8220;Chronicle of a Fall&#8221;&nbsp;is an immersive, feature-length video installation depicting the fragmented, transient experience of a group of immigrants in the U.S. The work deals with a period in which interpersonal relationships, the experience of home, and one’s sense of presence and belonging have all been transformed and fractured by global capital, electronic media and government policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exhibit begins with a simple question asked of a group of six immigrant workers, primarily from the Global South and the Middle East: “What is home to you?”</p>



<p>Many of&nbsp;the immigrants or immigrant-born subjects of &#8220;Chronicle of a Fall,&#8221; including the artists themselves, have left one country in which democracy is cast in shadow for the U.S., where democracy is under threat by U.S. citizens enabled by American politics. The work’s multiple videos convey the disjointed nature of the immigrant subjects’ experiences, providing an intimate and visceral insight into their daily lives and domestic environments.</p>



<p>“UIC Gallery 400 is thrilled to debut the breathtaking &#8216;Chronicle of a Fall&#8217; at its more than 90-minute full length. The filmmakers have created a mesmerizing environment that encompasses the absorbing scenes in which the work’s immigrant participants provide intimate insights into their experiences of disjuncture, bias, love and yearning,” said Lorelei Stewart, director of UIC Gallery 400.</p>



<p>Referencing the 1961 documentary ”Chronicle of a Summer” by Jean Rouch, “Chronicle of a Fall” updates the former film’s cinema verité approach with emerging technologies such as parallel body-worn cameras used by both subjects and filmmakers, as well as through volumetric capture and projection mapping.</p>

Image courtesy of UIC Gallery 400.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Where &#8220;Chronicle of a Fall&#8221; highlights the uneven formation of immigrant identities and social bonds, &#8220;A Species of Theft&#8221;&nbsp;focuses on dispossession — the loss of possession, namely land or personhood — as an entry point for understanding how property ownership is generated.</p>



<p>The exhibit, which features artists Marwa Arsanios, Carolina Caycedo, Tomashi Jackson and Skawennati, is informed by complex historical understandings of displacement, immigration, labor and alienation between North America, Britain and Kurdistan. As a resource, land establishes personal and political connections related to belonging somewhere.&nbsp;Its theft and rendering as an object for control have shaped settler-colonial societies and what their conceptions of race and identity are, according to the exhibit.</p>



<p>“The artists in the exhibition dramatize various historical problems that remain present and ever-relevant today,” said Denny Mwaura, curator of &#8220;A Species of Theft&#8221; and assistant director of UIC Gallery 400. “I hope the show offers a meditative and educational experience that enables deeper reflections on our relationship to earth.”</p>



<p>“Species of Theft&#8221;&nbsp;borrows its title from theorist Robert Nichols’ book&nbsp;&#8220;Theft Is Property!&#8221; in which Nichols contends that &#8220;dispossession&#8221; is a form of theft — one dependent on law and race to produce and pave the way for property ownership. The featured artists converse with Nichols’ theory and are concerned with issues regarding citizenship, nation-building and self-governance. They employ video to recognize &#8220;futurity, eco-feminist practices and sovereignty with an emphasis on editing techniques and narrative structures that expand on mediated experiences across varying landscapes.&#8221;</p>



<p>During the run of the exhibitions, UIC&#8217;s Gallery 400 will hold multiple events featuring &#8220;Chronicle of a Fall&#8221; participants, a screening of Jean Rouch’s 1961 Chronicle of a Summer, a conversation with artists Nadav Assor and Tirtza Even, and additional screenings of related works by contemporary film artists.</p>



<p>Support for&nbsp;&#8220;Chronicle of a Fall&#8221;&nbsp;is provided by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the School of Art and Art History, the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts, and UIC. The exhibition is partially supported by a grant from the Illinois Arts Council Agency.</p>



<p>The artists developed &#8220;Chronicle of a Fall” in part through a fellowship with&nbsp;MIT Open Documentary Lab, 2019-2021, with additional support from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Connecticut College and the City of Chicago.</p>



<p>Support for&nbsp;“A Species of Theft”&nbsp;is provided by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and the School of Art &amp; Art History, College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts, UIC. The exhibition is partially supported by a grant from the Illinois Arts Council Agency.</p>



<p>Visit <a href="https://gallery400.uic.edu/">UIC Gallery 400</a> for full details and upcoming related programs. The gallery is open Tuesday-Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturday, 12 to 5 p.m.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[New analysis published in JAMA Psychiatry]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2767408" target="_blank">recent studies</a> have demonstrated the effectiveness of brief suicide prevention interventions delivered in health care settings, a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2793520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new JAMA Psychiatry analysis</a> shows that the studies drastically underreport the strategies needed for the successful implementation of the interventions.</p>



<p>The University of Illinois Chicago psychologist who led the study found that researchers used around 26 strategies when implementing their interventions in clinical settings with patients during their studies. However, only four implementation strategies were typically described in the corresponding journal articles.</p>



<p>On average, about 85% of the strategies used for successful implementation — which could include things like training staff, making physical space available for appointments and updating billing processes — were missing from the published reports.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/?attachment_id=132095"><img loading="lazy" width="384" height="258" src="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Rudd-Headshot-2-384x258.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132095" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Rudd-Headshot-2-384x258.jpg 384w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Rudd-Headshot-2.jpg 574w, https://today.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Rudd-Headshot-2-500x336.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></a><figcaption>Brittany Rudd, UIC clinical instructor in the department of psychiatry at the College of Medicine.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“Providers in clinical settings need to know what it takes to implement novel interventions in their settings. When the studies these providers review to inform their work underreport implementation processes, it limits their ability to successfully integrate cutting-edge scientific discoveries into clinical care,” said <a href="https://www.psych.uic.edu/profile/brittany-n-rudd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brittany Rudd</a>, UIC clinical instructor of psychiatry at the College of Medicine. “In the case of interventions designed to reduce suicide attempts and increase treatment initiation, not sharing this information may create a missed opportunity to save lives.”</p>



<p>To conduct the study, the researchers used a standard <a href="https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-020-01060-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implementation reporting tool</a> that contains more than 70 distinct implementation strategies with standard names, definitions and categories. They reviewed the published studies to identify the strategies reported in the paper. The researchers also contacted the study authors and asked them to use the same reporting tool to indicate the strategies used during study implementation.</p>



<p>The two scores were compared, and the researchers not only saw a large and statistically significant difference in the number of strategies reported compared with the number used (4 vs. 26), but they also observed large differences for each implementation strategy category. Training and educating stakeholders were the most frequently reported types of implementation strategies in publications, but developing stakeholder relationships was the most frequently used, according to author reports.</p>



<p>“We need journals to require and allow space for researchers to describe their implementation processes so health care systems, clinics and individual providers can use those studies to make informed and realistic decisions about incorporating new interventions in patient care,” Rudd said. “Implementation of innovation to improve public health is the goal of scientific discovery. Basic science and clinical science results, no matter how promising, may not translate to better health for patients if implementation is not considered and shared at every translational step in science. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’m hopeful that all scientists will become attuned to the importance of implementation science and practice so we can improve public health,” Rudd said.</p>



<p>The JAMA Psychiatry article, “<a href="http://10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.1462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Implementation Strategies Used and Reported in Brief Suicide Prevention Intervention Studies</a>,” is co-authored by Catalina Ordorica of UIC, Molly Davis and Stephanie Doupnik of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Steven Marcus and Rinad Beidas of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>The research was supported by grants from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (T32MH109433, K23MH115162 and R01MH107452).</p>
