					<description><![CDATA[We are writing to provide an update on the status [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are writing to provide an update on the status of collective bargaining with UIC United Faculty, the union representing tenure/tenure-track and non-tenure track faculty with 51% time or more, including visiting faculty, at UIC.</p>



<p>Today was the 21st negotiating session, the fifth with the guidance of an independent federal mediator. To date, the parties have reached agreement on 15 of 23 contract items under deliberation and continue to make progress and exchange proposals that move us closer to resolution.</p>



<p>We are confident that much can be accomplished through continued bargaining. Negotiation sessions are already planned for Dec. 6 and 12. The university offered to meet again later this week and anticipate additional sessions will be scheduled to move this contract forward.</p>



<p>UIC United Faculty filed the legally required 10-day Notice of Intent to Strike with the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board on Nov. 17. This does not mean that a strike will necessarily occur, and the union has not announced a strike date. All parties care deeply about our students and keep their best interests at heart.&nbsp;The university’s intent is to resolve these negotiations without any disruption to teaching and learning—especially as we head into finals next week.</p>



<p>The university will continue to provide updates to our campus community regarding significant developments in negotiations via email and on our website at&nbsp;<a href="http://facultybargaining.uic.edu/">facultybargaining.uic.edu</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UIC Chancellor’s Committee on the Status of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer+ People and the Gender and Sexuality Center are shocked and saddened by the recent mass shooting at a Colorado Springs nightclub. We wholeheartedly condemn the violence, hatred and bigotry that led to the deaths of five individuals.</p>
<p>Each time a tragedy like this occurs, it carries a heavy emotional and physical toll on our community. Your well-being is our primary concern.</p>
<p>UIC reinforces its commitment to greater inclusion with the following support resources for students, faculty and staff:</p>
<ul>
<li>UIC Gender and Sexuality Center <a href="https://gsc.uic.edu/programs/therapy-groups/">Therapy Groups.</a></li>

<p>Two University of Illinois Chicago engineering students were recently named ComEd Scholars and will be provided scholarships to fill the tuition gap not covered by financial aid.</p>



<p>The students, Chanel Hamilton and Aaron Tillery, make up the 2022 ComEd Scholars fourth cohort and are part of the UIC CHANCE program’s <a href="https://chance.uic.edu/community-outreach/pre-college-programs/summer-camp-stem-academy/">STEM Academy</a>.</p>



<p>Tillery is a second-year student from Chicago’s Washington Heights neighborhood who is pursuing a degree in computer engineering, and Hamilton is a first-year student from suburban Country Club Hills who is pursuing an engineering degree.</p>



<p>Tillery said he was extremely grateful and honored to be one of ComEd’s new scholarship recipients. He said he was thankful for &#8220;all of the amazing leaders and staff&#8221; at UIC, CHANCE and ComEd.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since entering college, I have been able to work harder and get one step closer to my dream of becoming a computer engineer. Being able to build technology for the future and help my city is something that I strive to achieve,&#8221; Tillery said. &#8220;With the help of ComEd and the CHANCE program, I am on the path to doing so. I am blessed and excited about what the future holds.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a new college student and as a first-generation student, Hamilton said she appreciated the help and financial support that CHANCE and ComEd have offered her. The support began for her when she was involved in the program’s summer engineering class.</p>

Photo by Carl Ankrum.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>“Not only did I learn how to do some of the more difficult aspects of engineering as an aspiring engineer, but I also learned about the open and inclusive environment at UIC,” Hamilton said. “I was extremely excited to apply to UIC when I heard about this incredible opportunity with ComEd because I admire the work that ComEd has done for the community. I will make CHANCE and ComEd proud.” </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.comed.com/SafetyCommunity/Education/Pages/ForCollegeStudents.aspx">ComEd Scholars program</a> aims to invest in a diverse workforce, ComEd officials said. In addition to the UIC students, two students from the Illinois Institute of Technology, also known as Illinois Tech, also were recipients.</p>



<p>The ComEd Scholars program, in its fourth year, provides scholarships to students pursuing degrees in STEM that cover education-related costs that exceed financial aid. Since the ComEd Scholars Program&#8217;s inception in 2019, 26 students have been awarded support.</p>



<p>“ComEd’s commitment to creating the diverse STEM workforce of the future exemplifies what it means to create equitable pathways for the next generation of leaders and change-makers,” said UIC Interim Chancellor Javier Reyes. “We are thankful for this partnership and investment in UIC students.”</p>



<p>ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones said the scholarships represent “an investment in your academic and professional journey.” He said the company aims to provide students with exposure through its internships and assistance to become STEM leaders.</p>



<p>In addition to financial assistance, the ComEd Scholars are also granted the opportunity to interview for internships at ComEd and its parent company, Exelon, and are encouraged to participate in a mentorship program with ComEd engineers.</p>



<p>“At ComEd we are committed to diversifying the STEM workforce and supporting talented students from across our communities,” Quiniones said. “The ComEd Scholars program seeks to give students knowledge, confidence and resources to not only achieve their education and career aspirations, but to also have a meaningful impact in their communities for years to come.”</p>



<p>UIC’s <a href="https://chance.uic.edu/">CHANCE program</a> began in 2004 and was designed to assist the university with its goal to increase recruitment, retention and graduation rates of underrepresented students in partnership with Chicago Public Schools, City Colleges of Chicago, community-based organizations, various suburban school districts and charter schools. CHANCE stands for Counseling Help and Assistance Necessary for a 21st Century College Education.</p>



<p>&#8220;This partnership continues to enhance the lives of our scholars. The CHANCE Program is delighted to work with ComEd,” CHANCE Director Khalilah Young said. “This opportunity is life-altering; we are so grateful to ComEd for investing in the brilliant minds here at UIC.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Negotiations are continuing between the University of Illinois Chicago and UIC United Faculty, the labor union representing the bargaining units of tenure/tenure-track and nontenure-track faculty with 51% time or more, including visiting faculty, at UIC.</p>



<p>Since April 2022, the university and union have held almost 20 bargaining sessions and, recently, an independent mediator from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service was engaged to assist the parties in working toward a resolution.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the union held a strike authorization vote for its members and the result of that vote has not been announced at this time. This vote is advisory to union leadership and does not mean that a strike is imminent. Before a strike can occur, the union must provide the university with a 10-day notice of intent to strike. That has not occurred.</p>



<p>With 14 of 23 issues agreed upon to date and mostly economic articles yet to be resolved, the university remains fully committed to good-faith bargaining and the mediation process. At the beginning of negotiations, both UIC and UICUF agreed to first focus solely on resolving non-economic issues. The parties began exchanging proposals to address key economic issues in October. UIC believes continuing dialogue is the best path forward to come to a mutual agreement on the outstanding articles in the union contract.</p>



<p>The next bargaining session is scheduled for Nov. 22.</p>



<p>While negotiations progress, updates will continue to be provided to the campus community at <a href="https://facultybargaining.uic.edu">facultybargaining.uic.edu</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The campus Faculty Advisory Committee seeks nominations for faculty willing to serve in this major facet of shared governance at UIC. The committee is elected by the entire campus faculty by a ballot election.</p>
<p>According to the University <em>Statutes</em>, Article II, Section 4, the Faculty Advisory Committee shall provide for the orderly voicing of suggestions for the good of the University, afford added recourse for the consideration of grievances, and furnish a channel for direct and concerted communication between the academic staff and the administrative officers of the University on matters of interest or concern to the academic staff.</p>
<p>In addition to hearing and making recommendations on faculty grievances and adding a voice in communicating the concerns of the faculty to the administration, the committee has been specified by the UIC Senate to provide hearings for and make recommendations on cases involving severe sanctions short of dismissal. The University <em>Statutes</em>, Article IX, Section 6 were amended to permit procedures that could result in the imposition of serious sanctions other than dismissal of a faculty member.</p>
<p>The committee is composed of two non-tenure track and seven tenured faculty members. To be eligible, faculty may not hold an administrative position, must have three years of service at UIC, and must have at least a 75% appointment. Only senior rank and associate rank non-tenure track faculty members are eligible to serve. Terms are for three years and three members are elected each year. The University <em>Statutes</em> permit only two faculty members from any given college to serve at one time. Subsequent vacancies are filled from the list of nominees at the preceding election.</p>
<p>During this election cycle, nine members of the faculty are to be elected. Based on vote totals and due to unfilled seats from previous elections, the eligible nominees receiving the highest number of votes will be seated immediately to fill three-year terms ending in 2026; three nominees will be seated to two-year terms ending in 2025; and three nominees will be seated to a one-year term ending in 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://uofi.box.com/v/FACPetition">Forms are available online</a>.</p>
<p>Nominees will be asked to provide a short biographical sketch (no more than one paragraph of six lines) which will accompany the ballots. Nominations should be emailed to Elizabeth Dooley, clerk of the Senate, by Nov. 16, 2022, at <a href="mailto:edooley@uic.edu">edooley@uic.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For more information, please contact:</strong><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago continues its negotiations with the UIC United Faculty, the labor union representing the bargaining units of tenure/tenure-track and nontenure-track faculty with 51% time or more, including visiting faculty, at UIC. The union does not include faculty in the colleges of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy or the School of Law.</p>



<p>The previous four-year collective bargaining agreement between UIC and UICUF expired Aug. 15, 2022, but faculty union members have continued to receive compensation under the terms of the previous agreement as both parties work to reach a new contract.</p>



<p>Since April, the university and union have held 17 bargaining sessions and, recently, both parties agreed to add an independent mediator from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to assist the parties in working toward a resolution. The mediator joined for the 17th bargaining session, which took place Oct. 31.</p>



<p>Thus far the discussions between UIC and UICUF have led to 13 contract article agreements, including academic freedom, management rights, diversity and affirmative action, access to personnel file, no strike/no lockout and more. All remaining articles have been shared and are being negotiated, including economic proposals.</p>



<p>It is not uncommon for parties to be far apart where, as here, the parties have only exchanged initial economic proposals. Even so, and without the benefit of additional bargaining, UICUF announced after the Oct. 25 meeting that its members will have the opportunity to vote Nov. 14-15 to authorize its bargaining committee to call a strike if necessary. This does not mean that strike will occur. If approved by the membership, the union will have to file a Notice of Intent to Strike with the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board and allow for a 10-day waiting period.</p>



<p>While the economic-related articles are currently unresolved, we are eager to continue discussions as we believe much can be resolved through continued dialogue and the involvement of a federal mediator. It is important to note that the university recognizes the importance of its faculty and that under the last negotiated contract, the faculty union received the best guarantees of salary increases of any employee group or union.</p>



<p>UIC continues its commitment to good-faith negotiations with UICUF and will make every effort to reach an equitable and fiscally responsible contract agreement that addresses the needs of our faculty and the best interests of our entire campus community.</p>



<p>To keep our campus community informed, the university has created a website, <a href="https://facultybargaining.uic.edu/">facultybargaining.uic.edu</a>, to answer questions and share updates. We will continue to keep you updated with additional information, as needed, while our talks progress.</p>



<p>We look forward to the next bargaining session scheduled Nov. 7.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The UIC community is invited to participate in the “Reproductive [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UIC community is invited to participate in the “Reproductive Freedom for All” artmaking events to be held Thursday, Nov. 3, in Student Center East, and Monday, Nov. 7, in Student Center West, respectively. The events will run from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. each day.</p>
<p>Local artists, including UIC students and faculty, will be onsite to screenprint designs. UIC community members are encouraged to bring a personal item to print on. A limited supply of posters, T-shirts, tote bags and tea towels will be available. UIC student organizations that focus on reproductive health will table alongside voter education and reproductive justice organizations. The Nov. 3 event at SCE coincides with the Party to the Polls voter education program organized by UIC’s Student Civic Leadership Engagement office.</p>
<p>Co-organized by community organizer Roxana Espoz and Natalie Bennett, who is director of UIC’s Women’s Leadership and Resource Center, the RFFA event is intended to use collective artmaking to broaden support for reproductive justice on campus, increase awareness about the organizations working on reproductive issues in Chicago, and energize conversations about how UIC can go beyond making reproductive health care accessible towards realizing reproductive justice. Illinois has become a critically important state in terms of providing reproductive health care in the Midwest since the Dobbs decision in the U.S. Supreme Court. As more people come to the state in search of health care, public universities like UIC have a unique opportunity to shape the national conversation about what health care should look and feel like.</p>
<p>UIC is a Minority-Serving Institution that is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. Many of UIC’s students are also interested in health-allied fields, so they learn about the social determinants of health in classrooms. But some also confront the inequities in their personal lives, including challenges around access to reproductive health and parenting supports, etc. Alongside courses taught by UIC faculty and public programs offered at the university, creative interventions like “Reproductive Freedom for All” can ignite students’ interests in and passions about social justice. Through art, students can connect their personal and academic interests about reproductive health to larger movements, and begin to think differently about what they focus on in their professional and civic lives.</p>
<p>RFFA is supported by UIC Gender and Womens’ Studies Program, UIC Women’s Leadership and Resource Center, Blood Buds, SHAPE, Injustice Watch, Just Seeds, and Chicago Abortion Fund. For more information, contact Natalie Bennett, ndab1@uic.edu.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Guidance to keep the UIC community safe]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the fall of 2020, the UIC COVID-19 Contact Tracing and Epidemiology Program observed a sharp surge in cases following Halloween weekend, when numerous gatherings across campus, both large and small, were attended by individuals who were infected with COVID-19. Characteristically, attendees met indoors, did not wear masks, did not practice social distancing and commonly shared beverages or food.</p>
<p>A similar rise in cases occurred in the fall of 2021, following Halloween weekend. This high level of disease persisted through November, and skyrocketed in December and January as UIC community members traveled to visit family members for the winter holidays and the omicron variant emerged.</p>
<p>As we near Halloween and prepare for a number of festivities, we would like to remind you of the following guidance to keep you, your friends and loved ones, and the UIC community safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get vaccinated if you are not already. If you have not yet received the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html">updated COVID-19 booster</a>, consider scheduling it now.
<ul>
<li>Vaccination is best for protecting yourself and others from severe COVID-19 illness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not attend parties or gather with others if you have symptoms of COVID-19, no matter how mild.</li>
<li>Consider getting tested before an event or social gathering.
<ul>
<li>Testing is especially important when multiple households are gathering.</li>
<li><a href="https://today.uic.edu/covid-19-saliva-testing">Saliva testing</a> is quick, convenient, and no appointment is required.</li>
<li>While PCR tests are most reliable, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/self-testing.html">COVID-19 self-tests</a> are easy to use, produce rapid results and can be found in pharmacies or online.
<ul>
<li>Repeat testing is recommended if attending a gathering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you’re hosting a gathering, try and stay outdoors as much as possible. If indoors, opening windows increases a space’s ventilation and reduces the number of COVID-19 virus particles.</li>
<li>Serve packaged or pre-portioned snacks and beverages. You should not share food or drinks with others.</li>
<li>Practice good hand hygiene if you or your family is out trick-or-treating by bringing hand sanitizer. If you are passing out candy, make sure to wash your hands frequently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>UIC faculty and staff who would like to receive the COVID-19 bivalent booster from the University Health Service can schedule an appointment in <a href="https://hes32-ctp.trendmicro.com/wis/clicktime/v1/query?url=https%3a%2f%2fimmuware%2duic.azurewebsites.net%2fAccount%2fLogin&amp;umid=44a72d91-719e-4214-a920-6a4eeb401f85&amp;auth=cb8e2e5f0380db52462dcdd50199f593f72a1c1e-28970a5d0db984276287a233b47482163fb41e0f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immuware</a>.</p>
<p>UIC also has updated its <a href="https://covid-dashboard.uic.edu/data/">COVID-19 dashboard</a>, which shows the number of COVID-19 cases among UIC students and employees, as reported to UIC contact tracing.</p>
<p>To minimize the spread of COVID-19, the university has established isolation and post-exposure procedures for all members of the UIC community who have been exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19. Please review the <a href="https://today.uic.edu/isolation-and-quarantine/">updated isolation and exposure guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>The University of Illinois Chicago is one of six institutions that will split an $8.8 million National Science Foundation grant to develop theories, research methods and tools to help expand and tailor the field of STEM education to support Black students.</p>



<p>The five-year project will be led by Terrell Morton, UIC assistant professor of identity and justice in STEM education. He will serve as the principal investigator for the overall project and for UIC specifically. Other universities involved in the effort include Tennessee State University, the University of Texas at Austin, American University, Georgia State University and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.</p>



<p>The title of the project is, “Collaborative Research: EHR Racial Equity: Examining Blackness in Postsecondary STEM Education through a Multidimensional-Multiplicative Lens.”</p>



<p>Morton, who is in the department of educational psychology in the College of Education, said that while there is a lot of desire to foster racial equity, particularly at the policy level in STEM education, the assumption is often that every Black person is homogeneous, simply because of their shared racial identity.</p>



<p>“We assume that every Black person needs the exact same thing because of their racial identity as Black,” Morton said. “The purpose of this project is to say that not every Black person is the same, even if they all racially identify as Black.”</p>



<p>The goal is to develop and tailor racial equity-focused policies and practices in STEM education and to facilitate increased access and sustained engagement in STEM for Black undergraduate students. This includes looking at what “Blackness means for individuals,” Morton said.</p>



<p>Morton points to contemporary literature that suggests that the embodiment of “Blackness” differs according to many dimensions, including ethnic identity, where people grew up and if they are the first in their family to attend college, how far back their ancestry is traced in the U.S. and other factors.</p>



<p>“As a result of these different identity factors in addition to our gender identity, sexuality, religion and other salient identities we may understand the world differently,” he said. “If we want to create policies in STEM education that are equitable and pay attention to how people see the world, we need to create new tools and theories and outcomes.”</p>



<p>The schools involved in the project are purposely diverse and include two historically Black colleges and universities, two predominantly white institutions, one majority Black institution and one Hispanic-Serving Institution. They are also located in geographically distinct areas, including the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Southwest and Midwest regions, to gain a broader representation to analyze.</p>



<p>Each of the schools will serve as its own research site but will share protocols, recruitment practices and perspectives. Each of the institutions will implement the protocols in their regions. For example, Morton will be tasked with taking the created protocols and instruments and implementing them in the Chicago region through the recruitment of Black undergraduate students at four-year universities in the Chicago area who will share how they understand their identity as Black within STEM.  Eventually, a national survey would be created and analyzed.</p>



<p>“This project will produce tools of analysis and translational products that will change how institutional and organizational policies, practices and future research treat Black people in STEM, thereby promoting tailored resources and supports to meet Black people’s nuanced needs,” according to the grant.</p>



<p>The funding comes from the NSF’s Racial Equity in STEM Education program. The program supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of STEM education and workforce.</p>



<p>“This program aligns with NSF’s core value of supporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the nation’s diversity of demographic groups, regions and types of organizations,” according to NSF officials.</p>

<p>Several dozen students, faculty members and alumni gathered recently at the University of Illinois Chicago to celebrate the inception of a new major and Bachelor of Arts degree in global Asian studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GLAS major is being offered in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and is the first of its kind in the Midwest. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-announces-newly-created-global-asian-studies-major/" target="_blank">program</a> engages in interdisciplinary study of Asia and transoceanic and transnational Asian diasporas. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Anna Guevarra, founding director of GLAS, told the audience members gathered at Student Center East that the major had been an idea that took more than 30 years to become a reality. She said it was an initiative led by students who used petitions, news stories, news releases and memoranda of understanding to get the university to offer more courses related to Asian American issues as well as greater representation.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was fought collectively and collaboratively with faculty, students and staff working together; this has been a dream since 1991,&#8221; said Guevarra, referencing a flyer for a “speak out” that students organized in 2006.</p>



<p>Guevarra, associate professor of global Asian studies, remarked that this dream also called for supporters to think beyond identity politics, with the students themselves explaining that “Asian Americans aren’t the only students underserved when Asian American studies does not exist.”</p>

<p>Amalia Pallares, vice chancellor for diversity, equity and engagement, said that as the head diversity officer in the university and as professor in the department of Latin American and Latino studies, she could not be happier to welcome the new major, which she called, “an incredible achievement.”</p>



<p>“It was really a distant dream for students and faculty in the 90s, and it has taken three decades to come to fruition,” Pallares said.</p>



<p>She said that as a longtime member of the UIC faculty, one of her earliest memories on campus was seeing Asian students marching to demand Asian American resources and programming that “were pretty much nonexistent.”</p>



<p>The movement led to the creation of the Asian American Resource and Cultural Center and continued through the years, leading to the hiring of more Asian American faculty, the establishment of an academic unit and then eventually the offering of global Asian studies as a minor and now as a major, Pallares said.</p>



<p>“I can say that none of these things were easy, there were many challenges, many instances where those who were advocating for this were told there were no resources, no possibilities, no options,” Pallares said. “There were those who believed in the positive — and when they were told there were no resources found them elsewhere.”</p>



<p>Lisa Freeman, interim dean for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, said the global Asian studies program has been a “vibrant” and “dynamic” part of the college officially since 2016, but it is the culmination of decades of activism on the part of the campus and community partners. She credited Guevarra for her tireless efforts.</p>



<p>Freeman said the major brings together two “disparate but related disciplines,” Asian studies and Asian American studies. She said the program is interdisciplinary and includes courses and disciplines from art history to history and from political science to anthropology and sociology.</p>



<p>“The global Asian studies major is the first of its kind in the Midwest and only one of a handful of such programs nationwide,” Freeman said. “Professor Guevarra has worked incredibly hard to bring this program to life. She has not only built an academic program, she has built a community.”</p>

(Photo: Paul Goyette)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As part of the celebration, alumni were invited back on campus to discuss their time as UIC students and to celebrate the culmination of their efforts for greater representation.</p>



<p>One of those alumni was Naomi Leilani Salcedo, who in 2016 graduated from UIC with a Bachelor of Sociology degree and a minor in Asian American studies. Salcedo said when they and their classmates arrived at UIC in 2012, they were first exposed to ethnic studies.</p>



<p>“When I first came to campus, immediately I found AARCC (Asian American Resource and Cultural Center), and it felt like home, it really felt like a community,” Salcedo said. </p>



<p>Salcedo and their friends then took Asian American studies courses, minored in what was then called the Asian American studies program, and joined the program’s student advisory board. Upon graduating in 2016, Salcedo co-produced a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t1Vl3bG-9c&amp;t=17s">video tribute</a> to the program’s transition to global Asian studies. </p>



<p>Six years later, upon learning that GLAS was now a major, they said, “I felt a wave of emotion and in awe of collective power. My time at UIC ASAM was a transformative experience — one that lives out through my current work empowering and serving immigrants and refugees in Chicagoland.”</p>



<p>Brandon Mita, who graduated from UIC in 2006 with a bachelor’s degree in political science, served as the chairperson of the Asian American Coalition Committee. Mita recalled working with other Asian students and faculty to first get the cultural center, then Asian American Awareness Month, and later Asian American studies. Mita recalled trying to draw interest to their rally, dubbed “the speak out,” and fighting to get flyers up.</p>



<p>“I’m just so thankful that we have (gotten to this point),&#8221; Mita said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Chancellor’s Committee for the Status of LGBTQ+ People celebrates International Pronouns Day Wednesday, Oct. 19]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chancellor’s Committee for the Status of LGBTQ+ People celebrates <a href="https://pronounsday.org/">International Pronouns Day</a> Wednesday, Oct. 19. International Pronouns Day began in 2018. Its purpose is to make asking, sharing and respecting personal pronouns commonplace.</p>
<p>Referring to people by the name and <a href="https://www.mypronouns.org/">pronouns</a> they determine for themselves is a basic human dignity. Using someone’s correct pronouns is a way to respect them and create an inclusive environment, just as using a person’s name can be a way to respect them. Just as it can be offensive or harassing to make up a nickname for someone and call them that nickname against their will, it can be offensive or harassing to assume someone’s pronouns and refer to them using those pronouns if that is not how that person wants to be known.</p>
<p>Actively choosing to ignore the pronouns someone has stated that they go by could imply the oppressive notion that intersex, transgender, nonbinary and gender nonconforming people do not or should not exist. Acknowledging someone&#8217;s correct pronouns contributes to that person&#8217;s well-being by reducing harm and further trauma. Our committee reinforces our commitment to greater inclusion of LGBTQ+ folx at UIC with the following resources:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We invite interested departments to apply for a place in [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">We invite interested departments to apply for a place in the program this fall, which will provide them with the opportunity to recruit a scholar to start at UIC in fall 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Please see the call for applications below, where you can find links to register for the mandatory pre-application workshop and link to a Box folder where you can find this year’s updated application. We are also updating the call through this communication to allow for the possibility that departments may submit up to two unique applications for the program. If a department is interested in <strong>submitting a second application</strong> to the program, the department must request a consultation with the Bridge to Faculty admin team (<a href="mailto:bridgetofaculty@uic.edu">bridgetofaculty@uic.edu</a>) to discuss. All requests to submit a second application to the program must be submitted <strong>no later than Sept. 1</strong>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Bridge to Faculty is designed to recruit underrepresented, early career, research-focused scholars with the goal of providing department mentorship and support and the aim of transitioning them into faculty positions after this protected training period. This recruitment initiative aims to diversify our faculty by attracting and retaining promising scholars who are historically underrepresented in their fields of study, with particular emphasis on reflecting student enrollment patterns, significantly affecting student engagement and success, and increasing diversity in departments with low or no presence of underrepresented faculty. Salary support for the B2F scholar positions and the faculty hires that result will be provided by UIC’s central administration.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">UIC departments that are interested in diversifying their faculty through B2F are invited to apply to the program in pursuit of an opportunity to host a scholar starting at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. This is an open call to all campus departments, though we encourage departments that are interested in expanding their faculty expertise in areas of innovation and/or entrepreneurship to apply.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Departments that wish to apply to the program <strong>must</strong> send at least one department representative to the Bridge to Faculty Application Workshop, a virtual informational session about the program, scheduled for<strong>&nbsp;Tuesday, Aug. 30</strong>, from 10 a.m.–noon. <a href="http://go.uic.edu/B2F-AppWorkshop2022">Pre-registration for this workshop</a> is required. Applications will not be considered from departments unless at least one representative attends this virtual workshop.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Departments interested in applying are required to complete and return a program application. The program application is updated annually; the current application form can be accessed by faculty and staff via <a href="https://uofi.box.com/s/p1w007vc4h4orah2sf8qz96zlof3gpul">UIC Box</a>. Departments must demonstrate dean-level approval in their application (i.e., dean signature).&nbsp;<strong>Only one application per department is allowed </strong>unless discussed with and approved by the Bridge to Faculty admin team (<a href="mailto:bridgetofaculty@uic.edu">bridgetofaculty@uic.edu</a>).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline for applying to the Bridge to Faculty Scholars Program is 11:59 p.m. <strong>Monday, Sept. 19.</strong>&nbsp;Departments that have previously applied to the program may apply to the current call for applications and must complete all requirements specified in this call. The program application is updated annually, so please complete the application linked in this call.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Departments will be notified of selection by Oct. 4, and awarded departments must attend a post-award information session, scheduled for Friday, Oct. 7, from noon-2 p.m., before beginning any search activities. Selected departments will advertise the position, conduct a search and select their scholar. Searches must be advertised nationally, and all departments are required to conduct a competitive search (i.e., identify and interview multiple qualified candidates). Current and former UIC graduate students are welcome to apply for advertised B2F positions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the department mentorship outlined in the application, B2F Scholars will participate in cohort-based programming through the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Engagement, where they will have the opportunity to meet and interact with other program scholars. This programming is designed to complement the mentoring and support scholars receive from their departments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All finalists for any advertised Bridge to Faculty Scholar position must be eligible for an Aug. 16, 2023, start date.&nbsp;Further, a selected candidate for the Bridge to Faculty position must be at the appropriate career stage and development level to participate in and benefit from the scholar training period (e.g., less than five years beyond receiving a PhD, MFA, or other faculty-eligible terminal degree; less than five years beyond the end of medical fellowship training). B2F is designed as a two-year program. However, we welcome departments and colleges to discuss field norms and considerations with us to ensure that all departments at UIC have the potential to participate in the program. Requests for exceptions to lengthen the two-year scholar period will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">B2F Scholars must be provided with adequate time, resources and mentorship to focus primarily on progress toward research activities and scholarly publications. Some teaching responsibilities can be included but are&nbsp;not to exceed two courses&nbsp;for the duration of the scholar training period. Departments where teaching is not a required activity may specify&nbsp;no more than 20% FTE&nbsp;be devoted to clinical or applied work in lieu of teaching responsibilities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Bridge to Faculty Scholars Program is funded by the Chancellor’s Office and administered through the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Engagement. For more information about the application and process for applying, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Bridgetofaculty@uic.edu">Bridgetofaculty@uic.edu</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://innovation.uic.edu/proof-of-concept-awards-program/">POC Awards program</a> accelerates the commercialization&nbsp;<span class="il">of</span>&nbsp;technologies developed at&nbsp;<span class="il">UIC</span>&nbsp;by bridging the funding gap that often exists between research and the marketplace. Over $4.8 million in POC funding has been awarded to advance&nbsp;<span class="il">UIC</span>&nbsp;<span class="il">innovations</span>&nbsp;to date, supporting the development&nbsp;<span class="il">of</span>&nbsp;disruptive technologies across a wide range&nbsp;<span class="il">of</span> areas — from therapeutics and medical devices to engineering technologies. The deadline to apply is Sept. 6.</p>
<p>Selected proposals will receive up to $50,000 to advance early stage research toward commercialization. Researchers can apply for an additional $150,000 to support further technology development after successfully completing the initial project. Funding helps awardees achieve milestones that increase the potential for licensing to a company or enable the formation <span class="il">of</span>&nbsp;a startup.</p>
<p>To apply for POC funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Principal Investigator must be a full-time <span class="il">UIC</span> faculty or staff member.</li>
<li>PI must have an invention disclosure on file with the OTM prior to the application deadline.</li>
<li>Project must be focused on commercial product development or testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications will be reviewed by an internal committee&nbsp;<span class="il">of</span>&nbsp;<span class="il">UIC</span>&nbsp;experts. Selected finalists will have an opportunity to pitch their proposal to an external panel&nbsp;<span class="il">of</span>&nbsp;industry leaders and investors. POC awardees will be selected based on the project’s ability to successfully prepare the technology for commercialization within the proposed scope, requested budget and timeframe.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce the continuation of the Bridge [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are pleased to announce the continuation of the <a href="https://diversity.uic.edu/faculty/bridge-to-faculty/">Bridge to Faculty Scholars Program</a>. We invite interested departments to apply for a place in the program this fall, which will provide them with the opportunity to recruit a scholar to start at UIC in fall 2023.</p>
<p>B2F is designed to recruit underrepresented, early career, research-focused scholars with the goal of providing department mentorship and support and the aim of transitioning them into faculty positions after this protected training period. This recruitment initiative aims to diversify our faculty by attracting and retaining promising scholars who are historically underrepresented in their fields of study, with particular emphasis on reflecting student enrollment patterns, significantly affecting student engagement and success, and increasing diversity in departments with low or no presence of underrepresented faculty. Salary support for the B2F scholar positions and the faculty hires that result will be provided by UIC’s central administration.</p>
<p>UIC departments that are interested in diversifying their faculty through B2F are invited to apply to the program in pursuit of an opportunity to host a scholar starting at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. This is an open call to all campus departments, though we encourage departments that are interested in expanding their faculty expertise in areas of innovation and/or entrepreneurship to apply.</p>
<p>Departments that wish to apply to the program<strong> must </strong>send at least one department representative to the Bridge to Faculty Application Workshop, a virtual information session about the program, scheduled for<strong> Tuesday, Aug. 30</strong>, from 10 a.m.–noon. <a href="http://go.uic.edu/B2F-AppWorkshop2022">Pre-registration for this workshop</a> is required. Applications will not be considered from departments unless at least one representative attends this virtual workshop.</p>
<p>Departments interested in applying are required to complete and return a program application. The program application is updated annually; the current application form can be accessed by faculty and staff via <a href="https://uofi.box.com/s/p1w007vc4h4orah2sf8qz96zlof3gpul">UIC Box</a>. Departments must demonstrate dean-level approval in their application (i.e., dean signature). <strong>Only one application per department is allowed. </strong></p>
<p>The deadline for applying to the Bridge to Faculty Scholars Program is 11:59 p.m. <strong>Monday, Sept. 19.</strong> Departments that have previously applied to the program may apply to the current call for applications and must complete all requirements specified in this call. The program application is updated annually, so please complete the application linked in this call.</p>
<p>Departments will be notified of selection by Oct. 4, and awarded departments must attend a post-award information session, scheduled for Friday, Oct. 7, from noon-2 p.m., before beginning any search activities. Selected departments will advertise the position, conduct a search and select their scholar. Searches must be advertised nationally, and all departments are required to conduct a competitive search (i.e., identify and interview multiple qualified candidates). Current and former UIC graduate students are welcome to apply for advertised B2F positions.</p>
<p>In addition to the department mentorship outlined in the application, B2F Scholars will participate in cohort-based programming through the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Engagement, where they will have the opportunity to meet and interact with other program scholars. This programming is designed to complement the mentoring and support scholars receive from their departments.</p>
<p>All finalists for any advertised Bridge to Faculty Scholar position must be eligible for an Aug. 16, 2023, start date. Further, a selected candidate for the Bridge to Faculty position must be at the appropriate career stage and development level to participate in and benefit from the scholar training period (e.g., less than five years beyond receiving a PhD, MFA or other faculty-eligible terminal degree; less than five years beyond the end of medical fellowship training). B2F is designed as a two-year program. However, we welcome departments and colleges to discuss field norms and considerations with us to ensure that all departments at UIC have the potential to participate in the program. Requests for exceptions to lengthen the two-year scholar period will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>B2F Scholars must be provided with adequate time, resources and mentorship to focus primarily on progress toward research activities and scholarly publications. Some teaching responsibilities can be included but are not to exceed two courses for the duration of the scholar training period. Departments where teaching is not a required activity may specify no more than 20% FTE be devoted to clinical or applied work in lieu of teaching responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Bridge to Faculty Scholars Program is funded by the Chancellor’s Office and administered through the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Engagement. For more information about the application and process for applying, please contact <a href="mailto:Bridgetofaculty@uic.edu">Bridgetofaculty@uic.edu</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Statement on the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My UIC community,</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of the United States&#8217; decision to overturn a landmark case, Roe v. Wade, deeply saddens everyone. Not only does this target every woman in the United States, but it has a greater impact on low-income women and women of color.</p>
<p>In these difficult times, your student trustee and entire team of the Office of the Student Trustee is here, in support of our female friends&#8217;, colleagues&#8217;, sisters&#8217;, mothers&#8217;, and students&#8217; fundamental constitutional<br />rights to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive health.</p>
<p>I want to tell you all that although the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion care remains legal in Illinois. Our University of Illinois Healthcare System, through its dedicated physicians, nurses and medical staff remains committed to providing safe, high-quality and evidence-based care to our patients, including those seeking comprehensive reproductive health and family planning services regardless of your state. For us, we all are in this together and all are welcome!</p>
<p>Signed,<br />Lavleen Mal, Student Trustee<br />&amp; The Entire Team of The Office of the Student Trustee<br />University of Illinois Chicago</p>
<p> </p>


<p><i>This statement should not be taken as an official position of the University of Illinois Chicago.</i></p>

<p>The PREVENTABLE study is one of the largest research studies for older adults. We are looking to partner with people 75 years or older to learn if taking a statin could help older adults live well for longer by preventing dementia, disability or heart disease. A statin is a commonly used drug to lower cholesterol.</p>
<p>You may be a good fit for PREVENTABLE if you are 75 years or older, not taking a statin, and do not have heart disease, dementia or a significant disability that limits your basic everyday activities. The study will last about five years.</p>
<p>To find out more, contact Naomi Ashley at 312-355-0083 or <a href="mailto:naomiab@uic.edu">naomiab@uic.edu</a>. Or check out the <a href="http://www.preventabletrial.org">study website</a>.</p>

<p>The University of Illinois Chicago recognizes and celebrates the 11th annual Global Accessibility Awareness Day May 19. The third Thursday in May is dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of digital accessibility. People with disabilities must have the same opportunity to experience and use web-based services, content and other digital products as those without disabilities have. This awareness and commitment to inclusion is the goal of GAAD.</p>
<p>UIC understands the importance of accessible technology so people with disabilities can learn, work, participate and access information. The university is committed to the full inclusion of all people with disabilities, including access to all technologies and digital content used by UIC students, faculty, staff and visitors.</p>
<p>As part of the university’s commitment to providing accessible technology and content, JaEun (Jemma) Ku, PhD, joined UIC as the director of digital accessibility in November 2020.</p>
<p>“As Chicago’s largest and most diverse university, UIC has taken another step forward by considering digital access for all, including everyone with disabilities,&#8221; Ku said. &#8220;UIC is in the process of developing policies on the purchase and creation of accessible technologies and training faculty, staff and students on these policies and requirements. UIC&#8217;s endeavor on IT Accessibility will continue with the ICT Accessibility Policy and the Implementation Guidelines and other ongoing major IT accessibility projects on campus.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a new white paper from Quality Matters, &#8220;Course Design Considerations for Inclusion and Representation<em>,&#8221;</em> the concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion are explained in detail, based on research that shows the importance of incorporating these elements into online course design and the disadvantages many learners experience when they are not present.</p>
<p>Several models for developing inclusive course design are described, including Universal Design for Learning, for ensuring access to learning for all learners; Inclusive Design Thinking, which centers the design process on learner needs; and the Morrison, Ross and Kemp Instructional Design Model that includes nine core elements to be implemented cyclically.</p>
<p>Strategies for applying the psychosociocultural framework, which supports the redistribution of power in the learning space, validation theory and engagement practices that emancipate learners from the systems and barriers that may hinder their success are shared.</p>
